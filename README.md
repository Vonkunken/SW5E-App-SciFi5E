# SW5E-App-SciFi5E
I'm currently working on a mobile application to act as a rules reference for SW5e, I intend to also later fork this repository to make an alternative version with my own modifications of the rules and replacing the star wars lore with my own for me and my players convenience. 
But since I was already putting in the work to build this, why not also ensure there is an app for local offline reference to SW5E documentaiton.

# ToDo
There are are a lot, so this is by no means comprehensive.
- [ ] Add some form of funcitonallity to filter the list of weapons, at least a search of some kind.
- [ ] Create proper pages for armor, adventuring gear, and enhanced equipment.
- [ ] Create an actual home page.
- [ ] Creata an actual class page, probabably a scroll view, showing more than just name of the class, somewhat mimic the design on the SW5E website.
- [ ] Create a page to handle and display JSON data provided to it about the class, one page should be able to handle all classes, the current individual class pages aren't really needed.
- [ ] Create a species list based of the weapons page just using and displaying different data.
