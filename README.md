# SW5E-App-SciFi5E
I'm currently working on a mobile application to act as a rules reference for SW5e, I intend to also later fork this repository to make an alternative version with my own modifications of the rules and replacing the star wars lore with my own for me and my players convenience. 
But since I was already putting in the work to build this, why not also ensure there is an app for local offline reference to SW5E documentaiton.
