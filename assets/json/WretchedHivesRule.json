Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who�with the GM's permission�want to go a step further.\r\n\r\nThis chapter expands on feats, which are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.\r\n\r\n### Fighting Styles and Masteries\r\nWretched Hives introduces new ammunition types, such as the specialized power cells, or rockets. You'll want to extend the benefits of certain Fighting Styles and Fighting Masteries to these new munitions, as explained below.\r\n\r\n#### Explosives Style and Mastery\r\nYou will want to extend the benefits of this pair to include rockets.\r\n\r\n#### Area Style and Mastery\r\nYou will want to extend the benefits of this pair to include flechette clips, flechette mags, and projector tanks.\r\n\r\n#### Gunning Style and Mastery\r\nYou'll want to extend the benefits of this pair to include specialized power cells and slug cartridges.\r\n\r\n### Class Proficiencies\r\nCertain classes, such as fighters or guardians, gain proficiency in all weapons within a specific category. For instance, fighters gain proficiency in all blasters and vibroweapons, and guardians gain proficiency in all lightweapons and vibroweapons. Monk, operative, scholar, and sentinel, on the other hand, only gain proficiency in martial weapons that meet certain criteria. If that criteria is met due to the use of an item or feature that add�or remove�a referenced property, this does not grant that class proficiency in the weapon. For instance, operatives gain proficiency in simple blasters, simple vibroweapons, martial blasters that lack the auto, special, strength, and two-handed properties, martial vibroweapons with the finesse property. If they add the finesse property to a vibroweapon, or remove the strength property from a blaster weapon, this would not grant the operative proficiency in that weapon.\r\n\r\n## Feats\r\nA feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.\r\n\r\nYou must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow�perhaps by a withering curse�you can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.\r\n\r\n### Augmented Cyborg\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Type beast or humanoid_\r\nYou've experimented with cybernetic augmentations, granting the following benefits: \r\n- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- Choose one cybernetic augmentation of standard rarity from Appendix A. That augmentation is installed and doesn't count against the maximum cybernetic augmentations you can support, but it does count towards your total cybernetics augmentations as shown in the Cybernetic Augmentations Side Effects table in Chapter 7.\r\n\r\n### Customized Droid\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Type droid_\r\nYou've been customized beyond other droids of the same model, granting the following benefits: \r\n- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- Choose one droid customization of standard rarity from Appendix A. That customization is installed and doesn't count against the maximum droid customizations you can support, but it does count towards your maximum parts or protocols, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Investigative Attunement\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_\r\nYou've spent a significant amount of time appraising and testing enhanced items. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- Your maximum attunement increases by 1.\r\n- You have advantage on ability checks made to identify items.\r\n- Once per long rest, you can choose one object that you must touch for 10 minutes. If it is an enhanced or modified item, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any powers are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a power, you learn which power created it.\r\n\r\n### Muscled Menace\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Strength 13, size Medium_\r\nDespite being of otherwise average size, your might extends beyond that of your peers. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- Your speed increases by 5 feet.\r\n- You can't add more than +3 when determining your bonus to AC from your Dexterity.\r\n- You can't add more than +3 when determing your bonus to Dexterity saving throws from Dexterity.\r\n- You gain the Oversized special trait: ***Oversized.*** Light- and vibro-weapons that lack the dexterity or light property are considered to have the heavy property for you. The strength number for blasters is reduced by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If the strength number is 11, you ignore it entirely. \r\n\r\n### Savage Shorty\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Strength 13, size Small_\r\nDespite being short of stature, your size has no impact on your strength and virility. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- Your speed increases by 5 feet.\r\n- You lose the Undersized special trait.\r\n\r\n### Tiny Terror\r\n_**Prerequisite:** Strength 13, size Tiny_\r\nDespite falling below knee height of other species, your size has less impact on your strength and virility. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- Your speed increases by 5 feet.\r\n- You lose the Pintsized special trait, and you are no longer limited to +3 when determining your bonus to attack and damage rolls for weapon attacks using Strength due to the Puny special trait.\r\n- You gain the Undersized special trait: ***Undersized.*** Your small stature makes it hard for you to wield bigger weapons. You can't use heavy shields or martial weapons with the two-handed property unless it has the light property, and if a martial weapon has the versatile property, you can only wield it in two-hands.\r\n\r\n### Weapon Focused\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_\r\nYou adopt a particular type of weapon as your focus. Choose one of the weapon focus options, detailed later in this chapter. You can take this feat multiple times. \r\n\r\n### Weapon Supremacist\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 4th level_\r\nYou've mastered a particular type of weapon. Choose one of the weapon supremacist options, detailed later in this chapter. You can take this feat multiple times. \r\n\r\n## Weapon Focus\r\n\r\nThe Weapon Focused feat offers your choice of weapon focus. You can't take a weapon focus option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\r\n\r\n> #### Alternative Weapon Focus\r\n> Your weapon of choice may be governed by one weapon focus, whereas your character can be better realized utilizing a different focus. For instance, your blaster rifle might work better for you with Carbine Focus rather than Rifle Focus. Work with your GM to determine if a different focus is better suited, and mechanically appropriate, to your character's identity.\r\n> A weapon's focus and supremacy must match.\r\n\r\nYou may choose your weapon focus from the following options or roll on the table below to determine it randomly.\r\n\r\n|d8|Weapon Focus|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|Blade Weapon|\r\n|2|Carbine Weapon|\r\n|3|Crushing Weapon|\r\n|4|Heavy Weapon|\r\n\r\n|d8|Weapon Focus|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|5|Polearm Weapon|\r\n|6|Rifle Weapon|\r\n|7|Sidearm Weapon|\r\n|8|Trip Weapon|\r\n\r\n### Weapon Classifications\r\nEach weapon has a classification, as shown in Weapons by Class table later in this chapter, that determines which weapon focus it is governed by.\r\n\r\n#### Blade Focus\r\nYou've focused your combat training on blade weapons. You gain the following benefits while wielding any of these weapons, if you are proficient with it:\r\n- You gain a +1 bonus to the weapon's damage rolls.\r\n- When you score a critical hit with the weapon, the next attack roll the target makes before the start of your next turn has disadvantage.\r\n- When you take the Attack action, you can choose to forgo one or more attacks to **parry**.

If you have a free hand and the object is within your reach, you catch the object. Otherwise, it lands at your feet.\r\n- You can now reload these weapons using your reaction or object interaction, instead of just your action or bonus action. You must have one free hand to reload.\r\n- When you take the Attack action, you can choose to forgo one or more attacks to **daze** a creature. For each attack you forgo, you expend 2 ammunition and choose a creature that is no more than one size larger than you (your size or smaller if your weapon has the light property), has a head, and is within your weapon's normal range. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or become incapacitated until the end of its next turn or until it takes damage, whichever happens first.  If you could already daze, instead you can do so as your bonus action.\r\n\r\n#### Trip Weapon Supremacy\r\nYou've specialized your combat training with trip weapons. You gain the following benefits while wielding any of these weapons, if you are proficient with it:\r\n- You gain a +1 bonus to the weapon's attack rolls.\r\n- Whenever you have advantage on an attack roll and hit and the lower of the two d20 rolls would also hit (or a creature has disadvantage on a saving throw and the higher of the two d20s would also fail), and the target is no more than one size larger than you (your size or smaller if your weapon has the light property), it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or it drops an object of your choice. If you have a free hand, you catch the weapon. Otherwise, it lands at your feet. \r\n- You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks and attack rolls made to trip a creature.\r\n- When you take the Attack action, you can choose to forgo one or more attacks to **interrupt**. For each attack you forgo, one creature within your reach gains no benefit to armor class from its shield until the end of its next turn. If you could already interrupt, instead you can do so as your bonus action.\r\n\r\n##### Weapons by Class\r\n\r\n| Weapon | Class |\r\n|:---|:---|\r\n|\t Assault cannon        \t|\t Heavy \t|\r\n|\t

Items","chapterNumber":7,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 7: Enhanced Items\r\n\r\nThe ability to plunder enhanced items from the hoards of conquered pirates, or discover them in long-lost Sith tombs is an experience players expect. Such items grant capabilities a character could rarely have otherwise, or they complement their owner's capabilities in wondrous ways.\r\n\r\n### Rarity\r\nEach enhanced item has a rarity: standard, premium, prototype, advanced, legendary, or artifact. Standard enhanced items are the most plentiful. Consequently, higher rarity items are more scarce. The game assumes that the secrets of creating the most powerful items arose centuries ago and were then gradually lost as a result of wars or mishaps. Even premium items can't be easily created. Thus, many enhanced items are unique and well-preserved relics.\r\n\r\nRarity provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other enhanced items. Each rarity corresponds to a character level, as shown below in the Enhanced Item Rarity and Identification table. A character doesn't typically find a prototype enhanced item, for instance, until 5th-level or later. That said, rarity shouldn't get in the way of your campaign's story. If you want the darksaber to fall into the hands of 1st-level character, so be it. No doubt a great story will arise from that event.\r\n\r\n##### Enhanced Item Rarity and Identification\r\n|Rarity|Character Level|Identification DC|\r\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|\r\n|Standard|1st or higher|10|\r\n|Premium|1st or higher|14|\r\n|Prototype|5th or higher|18|\r\n|Advanced|9th or higher|22|\r\n|Legendary|13th or higher|26|\r\n|Artifact|17th or higher|30|\r\n\r\nIf your campaign allows for trade in enhanced items, rarity can also help you set prices for them. As the GM, you determine the value of an individual enhanced item based on its rarity. Suggested values are provided in the Enhanced Item Rarity table. The value of a consumable, such as a medpac or stimpac, is typically half the value of a permanent item of the same rarity.\r\n\r\n### Identifying Enhanced Items\r\nSome enhanced items have properties not readily distinguishable to the naked eye. Identifying such an item requires use of the *analyze* or *telemetry* power, or inspection with the appropriate tools.\r\n\r\nIf a player is proficient in the appropriate type of tools, as shown in the Tools by Item table on page \\_\\_\\_, they can make a check with the tools to identify the properties of an enhanced item over the course of a short rest. To use this benefit, they must have the tools, and the enhanced item must be within reach. The DC is found above in the Enhanced Item Rarity and Identification table.\r\n\r\n#### Variant: Simpler Identification\r\nIf you prefer enhanced items to be more readily identifiable, you can allow characters to identify enhanced items through experimentation. Over the course of a short rest, a character can focus on one enhanced item while being in physical contact with it. At the end of the short rest, the character learns the item's properties, as well as how to use them. \r\n\r\n### Attunement\r\nSome enhanced items require a creature to form a bond with them before their enhanced properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature must be a member of that class to attune to the item.\r\n\r\nWithout becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its unenhanced benefits. For example, an enhanced heavy shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal heavy shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its enhanced properties.\r\n\r\nAttuning to an item requires a creature to spend an uninterrupted short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it. This focus can take the form of weapon practice, meditation, or some other appropriate activity. At the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any enhanced properties of the item, including any necessary command words.\r\n\r\nAn item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to a maximum number of items equal to their proficiency bonus; any attempt to attune to an additional item fails. Standard, premium, and prototype items cost one attunement slot, while advanced, legendary and artifact cost two.\r\n\r\nA creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest with the item, unless the item is cursed.\r\n\r\n#### Variant: Simpler Attunement\r\nIf you prefer a simpler method, you can instead allow your characters to have a total of three attunement slots. If you do so, enhanced items should only take one attunement slot, regardless of rarity.\r\n\r\n### Cursed Items\r\nSome enhanced items bear curses that bedevil their users, sometimes long after a user has stopped using an item. An enhanced item's description specifies whether the item is cursed. Most methods of identifying items, such as the *analyze* tech power, fail to reveal such a curse, although lore might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item's user when the curse's effects are revealed. \r\n\r\nAttunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first.\r\n\r\n## Enhanced Item Categories\r\nEnhanced items fall into different categories depending on the type of enhanced item. Some categories, such as weapons and armor, are obvious. Others are less so.\r\n\r\n### Adventuring Gear\r\nItems that don't fall in one of the other categories are considered adventuring gear. They might be worn items, such as boots or a jetpack, or hand-held item like a holocron. This category is a catch-all for for items that don't fit in other categories. \r\n\r\n### Armor\r\nUnless an armor's description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its enhanced properties to function.\r\n\r\nSome suits of enhanced armor specify the type of armor they are, such as durasteel armor or combat suit, or the category in which they fall, such as light or heavy armor. If an enhanced armor doesn't specify its armor type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.\r\n\r\n### Consumables\r\nTypically, consumables are single use (unless the description says otherwise). Once a consumable is used, it takes effect immediately and is rendered useless.\r\n\r\nThe value of consumables, due to their impermanent nature, is typically half that of permanent enhanced items. Consumables are sub-categorized by their type: \r\n\r\n***Adrenals.*** Adrenals are designed to give a short term boost to a creature, like increased speed. Adrenal effects rarely last longer than a minute.\r\n\r\n***Ammunition.*** Ammunition is unique sources of power or temporary enhancements for weapons. \r\n\r\n***Barriers.*** Barriers offer temporary protection, usually to a single damage type, and rarely last longer than a minute.\r\n\r\n***Explosives.*** Explosives, such as cryo grenades or thermal detonators, are designed to cause an effect in a radius that varies depending on their nature. \r\n\r\n***Medpacs.*** Medpacs are used to restore hit points to creatures other than droids and constructs.\r\n\r\n***Poisons.*** Poisons are used to incapacitate or harm beasts and humanoids.\r\n\r\n***Stimpacs.*** Stimpacs offer boosts to creatures, like increasing an ability score, that typically last for an hour or more.\r\n\r\n***Substances.*** Substances are often illicit, such as spice or death sticks, or legal and common, like beer or wine. Substances confer a benefit at risk of addiction. Substances are discussed further later in this chapter.\r\n\r\n***Technology.*** Technology consumables are used to enhance interactions with technology and other uses, including repairing droids and constructs.\r\n\r\n### Cybernetic Augmentations\r\nCybernetic augmentations are enhancements built in to biological creatures, such as beasts or humanoids. They come in the form of replacements, which replace a physical body part, or enhancements, which simply augment a creature. Cybernetic augmentations are discussed further later in this chapter.\r\n\r\n### Droid Customizations\r\nDroid customizations are items that can enhance a droid in some way. They come in the form of parts, which replace a physical droid part, or protocols, which enhance the droid's functions in some way. Droid customizations are discussed later in this chapter.\r\n\r\n### Focuses\r\nFocuses are sub-categorized depending on what type of casting they augment: force or tech. \r\n\r\n***Force.*** Force focuses are used to augment the casting of force powers. The most common type of force focuses are focus generators, which are held in the hand of the forcecaster. Force focuses are not required to cast force powers.\r\n\r\n***Tech.*** Tech focuses are used to augment the casting of tech powers. The most common type of tech focuses are wristpads, which are worn on the forearm of the techcaster. Unlike force focuses, tech focuses are required to cast tech powers.\r\n\r\nA character can only benefit from one focus at a time. Once per round you can switch which focus you are benefiting from (no action required).\r\n\r\n### Modifiable Items\r\nSome enhanced items come with vacant slots for item modifications, which improve the enhanced item in some way. Typically, though not always, enhanced items have either built in properties or vacant modification slots, but not both. Modifiable items�and their modifications�are discussed further later in this chapter.\r\n\r\n### Shields\r\nLike armor, unless the description says otherwise, the shield must be actively wielded for its enhanced properties to function.\r\n\r\nSome shields specify the category in which they fall, such as light shield generator or any heavy shield. If an enhanced shield doesn't specify its category, you may choose the category or determine it randomly.\r\n\r\n### Weapons\r\nWhether crafted for a nefarious or benevolent purpose, weapons are among the most coveted of enhanced items.\r\n\r\nSome enhanced items specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a lightsaber or assault cannon, or the category in which they fall, such as vibroweapon or blaster.  If an enhanced weapon doesn't specific its weapon type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.\r\n\r\n## Awarding Enhanced Items\r\nEnhanced items are prized by adventurers are all sorts, often serving as the main reward for an adventurer. This section helps determine which enhanced items end up in the characters' possession.\r\n\r\n### Distribution \r\nThe Minor and Major Enhanced Items by Rarity tables below show the number of enhanced items a party of four should encounter during a campaign, culminating in 100 enhanced items accumulated by 20th level. The tables show much many of those items are meant to be handed out during the five tiers of play. The second and third tiers (levels 5-8 and 9-12, respectively) are intended to be when characters receive the majority of enhanced items, since these are the tiers where the majority of campaigns occur.\r\n\r\n#### Minor and Major Items\r\nThe most common distinction between minor and major enhanced items is attunement. All items that require attunement should be treated as major enhanced items. On the other hand, all consumables and item modifications should be treated as minor enhanced items. Many items, however, do not easily fall into those two categories. Generally, if the item has a significant impact on one of the three pillars of adventure�exploration, social interaction, or combat�but does not require attunement, it should nonetheless be treated as a major item.\r\n\r\nFor instance, armor +1 does not require attunement, but it has a significant impact in combat, so it should be treated as major. Mag-lock boots, however, don't significantly impact any aspect of gameplay, and thus should be treated as minor.\r\n\r\n### Choosing Items Level by Level\r\nYou decide when to place an item in an adventure that you're creating or modifying usually because you think the story calls for an enhanced item, the characters need one, or the players would be especially pleased to get one.\r\n\r\nWhen you want to select an item as treasure for an encounter, the Minor and Major Enhanced Items by Rarity tables serve as your item budget, as follows:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n- **1.** Jot down a copy of the table in your notes, so that you can make adjustments to the numbers as you select items to be placed in an adventure.\r\n- **2.** Refer to the line in the Character Level column that corresponds to the level of the player characters in your game. The entries in that row of the table indicate the total number of items that would be appropriate for the characters to receive by the end of the tier represented by that row.\r\n- **3.** Choose an enhanced item of any rarity for which the entry in this row is not 0.\r\n- **4.** When the characters obtain an item, modify your notes to indicate which part of your budget this expenditure came from by subtracting 1 from the appropriate entry in the table.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIn the future, if you choose an item of a rarity that's not available in the current tier but is still available in a lower tier, deduct the item from the lower tier. If all lower tiers also have no items available of a given rarity, deduct the item from a higher tier.\r\n\r\n##### Minor Enhanced Items by Rarity\r\n|Character Level|Standard|Premium|Prototype|Advanced|Legendary|Artifact|Total|\r\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1-4|6|3|�|�|�|�|9|\r\n|5-8|8|10|5|�|�|�|23|\r\n|9-12|2|4|6|7|�|�|19|\r\n|13-16|�|2|3|5|6|�|16|\r\n|17-20|�|�|2|3|4|4|13|\r\n|Total|16|19|16|15|10|4|80|\r\n\r\n##### Major Enhanced Items by Rarity\r\n|Character Level|Standard|Premium|Prototype|Advanced|Legendary|Artifact|Total|\r\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1-4|1|2|�|�|�|�|3|\r\n|5-8|�|1|4|�|�|�|5|\r\n|9-12|�|�|�|4|�|�|4|\r\n|13-16|�|�|�|�|4|�|4|\r\n|17-20|�|�|�|�|�|4|4|\r\n|Total|1|3|4|4|4|4|20|\r\n\r\n### Choosing Items Piecemeal\r\nIf you prefer a more free-form method of choosing enhanced items, simply select each enhanced item you want to give out; then, when th e characters acquire one, deduct it from the Enhanced Items by Rarity tables in your notes. Whenever you do so, start with the lowest level tier, and deduct the item from the first number you come across in the appropriate rarity column for the item, whether it's minor or major. If that tier doesn't have a number greater than 0 for that rarity, go up a tier until you find one that does, and deduct the enhanced item from that number. Following this process, you will zero out each row of the table in order, going from the lowest levels to the highest.\r\n\r\n> #### Generating New Enhanced Items\r\n> As a GM, you can easily generate new enhanced items by combining the effects of two like items, provided those items have the same type and subtype (if present). For instance, you could combine the effects of two item modification (augments) to create a new, higher rarity augment, but you couldn't combine the effects of a shield and a suit of armor to create a new item in this way.\r\n> When you do so, you want to combine the rarities of the items whose effects you are combining by assigning a point value to each item. A standard item has a value of 1, premium has a value of 2, and so on up to an artifact's value of 6. Add the points for the items you are combining to determine the new item's rarity. For instance, if you combine the effects a premium (2 points) augment with a prototype (3 points) augment, you end up with a new legendary augment due to the combined total of 5 points. You can't exceed 6 points when combining objects in this way.\r\n> If the two items you are combining confer a like bonus, such as a bonus to attack rolls or the save DC of force powers, that bonus should not exceed +3. If the items already include rules governing the maximum value that item could provide, such as a keen weapon modification, you would instead follow the guidelines provided by that item.\r\n\r\n### Overstocking an Adventure\r\nThe enhanced item tables in this chapter are based on the number of items the characters are expected to receive, not the number of items that are available in an adventure. When creating or modifying an adventure, assume that the characters won't find all of the items you place in it, unless most of the loot is in easy-to-find locations.\r\n\r\n> #### Are Enhanced Items Necessary?\r\n> Ultimately, this is a question that can only be answered at your table. Some players are more loot driven, while others prefer to focus on story. Generally, a normal campaign assumes that enhanced items appear sporadically and are a boon. Consequently, if your player characters obtain an inordinate amount of enhanced items, encounters might become progressively trivial. As a GM, you have to worry about maintaining that balance.\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Item Values\r\nThe value of an enhanced item varies depending on the rarity of the item, as shown below in the Enhanced Item Value by Rarity table.\r\n\r\nUsing the Enhanced Item Value by Rarity table, you then assign prices to the available items, based on their rarity. Halve the price of any consumable item, such as a medpac or explosive, or item modification when using the table to determine an item's value.\r\n\r\n##### Enhanced Item Value by Rarity\r\n|Rarity|Value|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|Standard|up to 1,000 cr|\r\n|Premium|1,001 to 5,000 cr|\r\n|Prototype|5,000 to 25,000 cr|\r\n|Advanced|25,000 - 100,000 cr|\r\n|Legendary|100,000 - 500,000 cr|\r\n|Artifact|at least 500,000 cr|\r\n\r\n#### Determine Values Randomly\r\nAlternatively, you can determine the value of enhanced items randomly. To do so, you should first roll percentile dice twice, keeping the higher total. Then, you should multiply the result by the modifier, depending on the item's rarity, as shown below in the Value Modifier by Rarity table.\r\n\r\n##### Value Modifier by Rarity\r\n|Rarity|Value Modifier|\r\n|:--:|--:|\r\n|Standard|10 cr|\r\n|Premium|50 cr|\r\n|Prototype|250 cr|\r\n|Advanced|1,000 cr|\r\n|Legendary|5,000 cr|\r\n|Artifact|25,000 cr|\r\n\r\nIf item value falls below the base threshold for that rarity, you might instead use the base for that rarity. For instance, if I want to determine the value of a prototype item, I first roll percentile dice twice. I get the results of 63 and 22, so I keep the 63 since it's the higher number. I then multiply that number by the value modifier for prototype (250 cr), ending up with an item value of 15,750 cr (63 x 250 cr). If I instead had rolled 11 and 16 on the percentile dice rolls, however, I would have ended up with an item value of 4,000 cr (16 x 250 cr). Since this falls below the minimum value threshold for prototype items (5,000 cr), you could instead use the minimum.\r\n\r\n> To reflect the availability of enhanced items in your campaign, you can apply a penalty or bonus, as appropriate to your setting, when resolving the d100 roll determining enhanced item values. \r\n\r\nWhen determining the value for an enhanced item that has an unenhanced version, such as a medpac or a blaster rifle, instead of replacing with the value determined by the rolls above, add the result to the unenhanced item's value.\r\n\r\n## Modifiable Items\r\nSome enhanced items come with fixed properties. Other enhanced items, called chassis, are more customizable. \r\n\r\n### Modifying Equipment\r\nModifying an item requires three key components: a modifiable item chassis, a modification to install, and the appropriate tools. An item can only be modified by someone proficient with appropriate tools, as shown in the Item Specific Tools table on page \\_\\_\\_.\r\n\r\n#### Modifiable Item Chassis\r\nEvery item chassis comes with at least four modification slots, increasing to six at higher rarities, as determined by the chassis's rarity, as shown below in the Modification Slots by Rarity table.\r\n\r\n##### Modification Slots by Rarity\r\n|Rarity|Modification Slots|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|Standard|4|\r\n|Premium|4|\r\n|Prototype|5|\r\n|Advanced|5|\r\n|Legendary|6|\r\n|Artifact|6|\r\n\r\nEvery modifiable item chassis has four base slots, determined by its type. Prototype and advanced modifiable item chassis also have one augment slot in addition to the four base slots for their type, while legendary and artifact have two. A modifiable item chassis only requires attunement and is considered enhanced if it has at least one modification installed.\r\n\r\nA modifiable item chassis can only include modifications of the same rarity or a lesser rarity. For instance, if you have a prototype modifiable item chassis, you can modify it with standard, premium, and prototype modifications. However, the item's nature does not allow it to support higher rarity modifications.\r\n\r\n#### Installing Modifications\r\nInstalling a modification takes one hour and requires an ability check with the appropriate tool, as shown in the Item Specific Tools table on page \\_\\_\\_. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the modification being installed, as shown below in the Installation/Removal DC by Rarity table.\r\n\r\n##### Installation/Removal DC by Rarity\r\n|Rarity|Installation/Removal DC|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|Standard|10|\r\n|Premium|14|\r\n|Prototype|18|\r\n|Advanced|22|\r\n|Legendary|26|\r\n|Artifact|30|\r\n\r\nOn a success, the modification is correctly installed. On a failure, the modification is not installed, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again.\r\n\r\n#### Removing Modifications\r\nRemoving a modification requires an ability check with the appropriate tool, as shown in the Item Specific Tools table. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the modification being removed, as shown above in the Installation/Removal DC by Rarity table.\r\n\r\nOn a success, the modification is removed and salvaged. On a failure, the modification is removed but destroyed.\r\n\r\n### Upgrading Modifiable Item Chassis\r\nModifiable item chassis can have their rarity upgraded over time. An item can only be upgraded by someone proficient with the appropriate tools, and it can only be upgraded one rarity step at a time. Modifying a chassis takes eight hours and requires an ability check with the appropriate tool. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity to which the chassis is being upgraded, as shown in the Installation/Removal DC by Rarity table above. Additionally, upgrading the rarity of a chassis requires an appropriate rare material, as discussed in the Crafting downtime activity. Upgrading a modifiable item chassis has no effect on any modifications currently installed in the chassis.\r\n\r\nOn a success, the modifiable item chassis is upgraded to the new rarity. On a failure, the modifiable item chassis is not upgraded, you must wait 24 hours before you can try again, and you must roll a d20. If you roll a 1 on the d20, one currently installed modification is destroyed. If the chassis has more than one modification installed, the GM should determine which modification is destroyed randomly.\r\n\r\n#### Color Crystals\r\nIn addition to the modifications unique to themselves, all lightweapons come with a slot for a color crystal. Typically, newly created lightweapons come with one of the more common color variants, such as green, blue, or red. Occasionally, a character might come across a more scarce color crystal. When determining what color crystal a lightweapon comes with, the GM can choose for the player, or have the player make a universal forcecasting ability check with proficiency. The result of the check affects the color of the crystal, as shown below in the Forcecasting Color Crystal Modifier table.\r\n\r\n##### Forcecasting Color Crystal Modifier\r\n|Forcecasting Ability Check DC|d100 RollItem modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n| 1|-15|\r\n| 5|-10|\r\n|10| -5|\r\n|15|  0|\r\n|20| +5|\r\n|25|+10|\r\n|30|+20|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Color Crystal table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nOnce a player has made their forcecasting ability check to discover a lightweapon color crystal, the player rolls percentile dice and consults the Color Crystal table below, applying a modifier based on the result of their forcecasting ability check.\r\n\r\n##### Color Crystal\r\n\r\n|d100|Crystal Color|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n| 1-20|Blue|\r\n|21-40|Red|\r\n|41-60|Green|\r\n|61-70|Yellow|\r\n|71-80|Purple|\r\n|81-90|Orange|\r\n\r\n|d100|Crystal Color|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|91-93|Viridian|\r\n|94-96|Cyan|\r\n|   97|Bronze|\r\n|   98|Silver|\r\n|   99|White|\r\n| 100+|Black|\r\n\r\n> This table includes the most common and desirable color crystals. More extensive options can be awarded at the discretion of the GM.\r\n\r\nA player can choose the color crystal that is the result of their percentile dice rolled, or they can choose one that falls below it. For instance, if the player rolls a 91 and finds a viridian color crystal, they could instead choose a yellow color crystal, as if they had rolled a 63.\r\n\r\n#### Augments\r\nAugments are intended to offer features universal across items, such as an increase to an ability score or augmenting a class feature.\r\n\r\nYou can't have two of the same augment in a single chassis, but you can have multiples of an augment, each in its own chassis.\r\n\r\n***Installing Augments in Other Items.*** Additionally, a character proficient in tinker's implements can add modification slots for augments to items that lack them. First, the character must spend one uninterrupted hour tinkering with the item, which can be done over a short rest, with their tinker's implements. The character must then make an ability check with tinker's implements. On a result of less than 20, the item gains no augment slots, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again. On a result of 20 or higher, the item gains one augment slot, to a maximum of one augment slot. On a result of 30 or higher, the item gains a two augment slots, to a maximum of two augment slots. Adding augment slots to an item causes that item to require attunement, if it didn't already. An item can't support augments of higher rarity than the item's rarity.\r\n\r\n#### Variant: Common Modifications\r\nModifying equipment is a common expectation of adventurers foraying through the worlds of *Star Wars*. This rule treats all potential modifiable items�that is, the eight categories listed in this chapter�as unmodified standard rarity chassis. For example, every unenhanced blaster you find while adventuring, or for sale in a market, comes with vacant modification slots for blaster modifications.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, all modifications of standard rarity should be available for purchase from appropriate vendors without using the Buying Enhanced Items downtime activity.\r\n\r\n> Note that all chassis of premium or higher rarity should still be treated as enhanced items for the purposes of distribution.\r\n\r\n## Cybernetic Augmentations\r\nSome characters are dissatisfied with their inborn gifts, while some are simply looking to augment their natural prowess. The less fortunate, however, might find themselves missing a limb. For all of these characters, cybernetic augmentations suit a purpose.\r\n\r\n### Augmenting Creatures\r\nAugmenting a creature with cybernetic enhancements requires three key components: a valid target for the augmentation, an augmentation to install, and biotech's implements. A creature can only be modified by someone with proficiency in biotech's implements.\r\n\r\n#### Valid Targets\r\nTypically, only beasts and humanoids are valid targets for augmentations. A creature can support a number of cybernetic augmentations equal to their proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Augmentation Time\r\nIt takes 8 hours to install an augmentation in a Medium creature. The time it takes to install an augmentation in a creature of another size varies based on the size of the target, as shown below in the Creature Size Time Modifier table below.\r\n\r\n##### Creature Size Time Modifier\r\n| Creature Size | Time Modifier |\r\n|:----:|:-------------|\r\n| Tiny  |x 0.25 |\r\n| Small |x 0.5 |\r\n| Medium |x 1 |\r\n| Large |x 2 |\r\n| Huge |x 5 |\r\n| Gargantuan |x 10 |\r\n\r\nFor instance, to install an augmentation in a Medium creature takes 8 hours. To install an augmentation in a Huge creature, however, it takes 40 hours (5 x 8).\r\n\r\nThe installer works 8 hours per day. It costs 100 credits per hour if the operation is performed by an NPC. \r\n\r\n#### Side Effects\r\nIn addition to the side effects associated with each augmentation, your body undergoes changes, depending on how many augmentations you adopt, as shown below in the Cybernetic Augmentation Side Effects table.\r\n\r\n##### Cybernetic Augmentation Side Effects\r\n|Number of Augmentations|Side Effect|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|2|You have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that deal ion damage.|\r\n|4|You have vulnerability to ion damage.|\r\n|6|You count as a droid for powers that affect only droids or constructs.|\r\n\r\n### Installing Augmentations\r\nIn addition to the time and cost requirement, installing an augmentation requires an ability check with biotech's implements. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the augmentation being installed, as shown in the Installation/Removal DC by Rarity table on page \\_\\_\\.\r\n\r\nOn a success, the augmentation is correctly installed. On a failure, the augmentation is not installed, the time and credits are spent, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again. Additionally, on a failure, the recipient suffers another effect, depending on the type of augmentation installed:\r\n- **Enhancement:** On a failure, the recipient suffers one level of exhaustion.\r\n- **Replacement:** On a failure, the recipient loses the ability to use the part being replaced for a period of time equal to the time it would take to install the replacement. For instance, to install an arm replacement in a Huge creature it takes 40 hours, performed over five days. If, at the end of the five day period, the installer fails the ability check with biotech's implements, the Huge creature loses the ability to use that arm for five days. \r\n\r\n### Removing Augmentations\r\nRemoving an augmentation takes half the time and credits it would to install, and requires an ability check with biotech's implements. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the augmentation being removed, as shown in the Installation/Removal DC by Rarity table on page \\_\\_\\.\r\n\r\nOn a success, the augmentation is removed and salvaged. On a failure, the augmentation is removed but destroyed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if removing a replacement augmentation, the recipient loses the ability to use the missing part until it receives another suitable replacement.\r\n\r\n### Augmentation Categories\r\nTwo major categories of cybernetic augmentations exist in the galaxy: enhancements and replacements.\r\n\r\n#### Enhancements\r\nEnhancements bestowed new abilities or improved the recipient in some fashion. Enhancements included skeletal reinforcement, subcutaneous communications hardware, and weapon mounts. Some enhancements have visible external components, while others were hidden beneath the skin. \r\n\r\n#### Replacements\r\nReplacements are prosthetic or artificial units intended to replace limbs and damaged organs. Common replacements provided no benefits other than duplicating the essential functions of their biological counterparts. In appearance, a cybernetic replacement could be recognizably artificial or virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. \r\n\r\n## Droid Customizations\r\nDroids vary in form and function. Beyond simply their droid classification and subtype, many droids�or their owners�crave further customizability. Droid customizations are designed for this purpose.\r\n\r\n### Customizing Droids\r\nCustomizing a droid with droid-specific equipment requires three key components: a droid with a valid slot for the equipment, a piece of equipment to install, and astrotech's implements. A droid can only be customized by someone with proficiency in astrotech's implements.\r\n\r\n#### Valid Targets\r\nOnly droids are valid targets for droid customizations. A droid's motor can support two droid customizations, and can be upgraded to support up to six customizations. \r\n\r\n#### Customization Time\r\nIt takes 8 hours to install a customization in a Medium droid. The time it takes to install a customization in a droid of another size varies based on the size of the target, as shown in the Droid Size Time Modifier table below.\r\n\r\n##### Droid Size Time Modifier\r\n| Droid Size | Time Modifier |\r\n|:----:|:-------------|\r\n| Tiny  |x 0.25 |\r\n| Small |x 0.5 |\r\n| Medium |x 1 |\r\n| Large |x 2 |\r\n| Huge |x 5 |\r\n| Gargantuan |x 10 |\r\n\r\nFor instance, to install a customization in a Medium droid takes 8 hours. To install an augmentation in a Huge droid, however, it takes 40 hours (5 x 8).\r\n\r\nThe installer works 8 hours per day. It costs 100 credits per hour if the operation is performed by an NPC. \r\n\r\n#### Motor Upgrading\r\nA droid's motor can be upgraded to support more customizations, up to a maximum of six customizations. To upgrade the motor in a Medium droid, it takes 8 hours and a number of credits depending on the total number of slots the upgraded motor grants, as shown below  in the Total Slots Upgrade Cost table.\r\n\r\n##### Total Slots Upgrade Cost\r\n|Total Slots|Upgrade Cost|\r\n|:--:|--:|\r\n|3| 2,000 cr|\r\n|4| 10,000 cr|\r\n|5| 50,000 cr|\r\n|6| 200,000 cr|\r\n\r\nThe time and cost it takes to upgrade a motor in a droid of another size varies based on the size of the target, as shown in the Droid Size Time Modifier table.\r\n\r\nFor instance, to upgrade a Medium droid's motor from 2 slots to 3 slots, it takes 8 hours and 2,000 cr. To upgrade a Huge droid's motor from 3 slots to 4 slots, however, it takes 40 hours (5 x 8) and 50,000 cr (5 x 10,000).\r\n\r\nThe installer works 8 hours a day. It costs 100 credits per hour if the operation is performed by an NPC.\r\n\r\n### Installing Customizations\r\nIn addition to the time and cost requirement, installing a customization requires an ability check with astrotech's implements. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the customization being installed, as shown in the Installation/Removal DC by Rarity table on page \\_\\_\\.\r\n\r\nOn a success, the customization is correctly installed. On a failure, the customization is not installed, the time and credits are spent, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again. \r\n\r\n### Removing Customizations\r\nRemoving a customization takes half the time and credits it would to install, and requires an ability check with astrotech's implements. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the customization being removed, as shown in the Installation/Removal DC by Rarity table on page \\_\\_\\.\r\n\r\nOn a success, the customization is removed and salvaged. On a failure, the customization is removed but destroyed.\r\n\r\n### Customization Categories\r\nTwo major categories of droid customizations exist in the galaxy: parts and protocols. \r\n\r\n#### Parts\r\nParts typically enhance or replace the features of a droid. Additional arms, integrated shield generators or weapons, or built-in repulsor lifts. You can't have more parts than your Strength, Dexterity or Constitution modifier (your choice, minimum of one).\r\n\r\n#### Protocols\r\nProtocols bestow new abilities or improvements on the target droid. Typically, they take the shape of systems improvements and offer no visible indication that they exist. You can't have more protocols than your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of one).","contentTypeEnum":0,"contentType":"None","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"7","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Entertainment and Downtime","chapterNumber":2,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 2: Entertainment and Downtime\r\n\r\nAny campaign benefits when characters have time between  adventures to engage in other activities. Allowing days, weeks, or months to pass between adventures stretches the campaign over a longer period of time and helps to manage the characters' level progression, preventing them from gaining too much power too quickly.\r\n\r\nAllowing characters to pursue side interests between adventures also encourages players to become more invested in the campaign world(s). When a character owns a cantina in a city or spends time carousing with the locals, the character's player becomes more likely to respond to threats to the city and its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAs your campaign progresses, your players' characters will not only become more powerful, but also more influential and invested in the world. They might be inclined to undertake projects that require more time between adventures, such as building and maintaining a stronghold. As the party gains levels, you can add more downtime between adventures to give characters the time they need to pursue such interests. Whereas days or weeks might pass between low-level adventures, the amount of downtime between higher-level adventures might be measured in months or years.\r\n\r\nDowntime activities are tasks that usually take a workweek (five days of work plus two days of rest) or longer to perform. These tasks can include buying or creating enhanced items, criminal activities, general carousing, or simply working a job. A character selects a downtime activity from among those available, and you, as GM, then follow the rules for the activity to resolve it, informing the player of the results and any complications that ensue.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nEach activity has a resource requirement, typically comprised of money and time, though some may have greater requirements. The required amount of money and time to perform an activity varies, as described in the activity's resource description.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nThe Resolution portion of each activity's description tells you how to resolve it. Many activities require an ability check, so be sure to note the character's relevant ability modifiers. Follow the steps in the activity, and determine the results.\r\n\r\nMost downtime activities require at least a workweek to complete. Some activities require days, weeks (7 days), or even months (30 days). A character must spend at least 8 hours of each day engaged in the downtime activity for that day to count toward the activity's completion.\r\n\r\nFor many downtime activities, the days of an activity don't need to be consecutive; you can spread them over a longer period of time than is required for the activity. But that period should be no more than twice as long as the required time, otherwise you risk introducing additional complications (see below), and possibly double the activity's costs to represent the inefficiency of the character's progress.\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nThe description of each activity includes a discussion of complications you can throw at the characters. The consequences of a complication might spawn entire adventures, introduce NPCs to vex the party, or give characters headaches and advantages in any number of other ways. One of the most common�and recurring�types of complications is the introduction of rivals.\r\n\r\nEach of these sections has a table that offers possible complications. You can use a complication from the table, or invent your own complication. \r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nWhile most downtime activities aren't suitable for enacting during a session due to the requisite time requirements, others are. For those activities suitable for engaging in during a session, uptime exists. Uptime rules cover what actions need to be taken. Uptime rules often use their own resources, Resolution, and complications.\r\n\r\n## Rivals\r\nRivals are NPCs who oppose the characters and make their presence felt whenever the characters are engaging in downtime. A rival might be a villain you have featured in past adventures or plan to use in the future. Rivals can include more than just malicious entities�they might be unaligned folk who are at odds with the characters, whether because they have opposing goals or they simply dislike one another. A rival might be a third party the players inadvertently snubbed throughout their adventures, or simply a vindictive bystander who is convinced that the party is up to no good.\r\n\r\nA rival's agenda changes over time. Though the characters engage in downtime only between adventures, their rivals rarely rest, continuing to spin plots and work against the characters even when the characters are off doing something else.\r\n\r\n### Creating a Rival\r\nIt's possible for the characters to have one or more rivals at a time, each with a separate agenda. At least one should be a villain, while the others might not be nefarious characters; conflicts with those rivals might be social or political, rather than manifesting as direct attacks.\r\n\r\nThe best rivals have a connection with their adversaries on a personal level. Find links in the characters' backstories or the events of recent adventures that explain what sparked the rival's actions. The best trouble to put the characters in is trouble they created for themselves. You can find sample rival ties in the Example Rivals table to the right.\r\n\r\nTo add the right amount of detail to a rival you want to create, give some thought to what the NPC is trying to accomplish and what resources and methods the rival can bring to bear against the characters.\r\n\r\n#### Goals\r\nAn effective rival has a clear reason for interfering with the characters' lives. Think about what the rival wants, how and why the characters stand in the way, and how the conflict could be resolved. Ideally, a rival's goal directly involves the characters or something they care about.\r\n\r\n#### Plans\r\nThe foundation of a rival's presence in the campaign is the actions the rival takes or the events that occur as a result of that character's goals. Each time you resolve one or more workweeks of downtime, pick one of the ways a rival's plans might be advanced and introduce it into play.\r\n\r\nThink about how a rival might operate in order to bring specific plans to fruition, and jot down three or four kinds of **actions** the rival might undertake. Some of these might be versions of the downtime activities described in the \\-\\-\\- chapter, but these are more often efforts specific to that rival. These actions might be a direct attack, such as an assassination attempt, that you can play out during a session, or it might be a background activity that you describe as altering the campaign in some way. For instance, if the characters pursue a specific artifact, the rival might learn of the plans and attempt to retrieve it first. \r\n\r\n##### Example Rivals\r\n|d20|Rival|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n| 1|Tax collector who is convinced the characters are dodging fees.|\r\n| 2|Politician who is concerned the characters are causing more trouble than they solve.|\r\n| 3|Faction leader who worries the characters are diminishing their faction's prestige.|\r\n| 4|Affluent individual who blames the characters for some recent troubles.|\r\n| 5|Rival adventuring party.|\r\n| 6|Individual who loves a scandal enough to spark one.|\r\n| 7|Childhood rival or member of a rival clan or faction.|\r\n| 8|Scorned sibling or parent.|\r\n| 9|Merchant who blames the characters for any business woes.|\r\n|10|Newcomer out to make a mark on the world.|\r\n|11|Sibling or ally of a defeated enemy.|\r\n|12|Official seeking to restore a tarnished reputation.|\r\n|13|Deadly foe disguised as a social rival.|\r\n|14|Nefarious character seeking to subvert the party.|\r\n|15|Spurned romantic interest.|\r\n|16|Political opportunist seeking a scapegoat.|\r\n|17|Traitorous noble looking to foment a revolution.|\r\n|18|Would-be tyrant who brooks no opposition.|\r\n|19|Exiled noble looking for revenge.|\r\n|20|Corrupt official worried that recent misdeeds will be revealed.|\r\n\r\nSome elements of a rivals plans might involve **events** in the world that aren't under the rival's control. Whether such an event can be easily anticipated or not, the rival's plans might include contigencies for taking advantage of such happenings.\r\n\r\n#### Assets\r\nThink about the resources the rival can marshal. Does the character have enough money to pay bribes or to hire a small gang of mercenaries? Does the rival hold sway over any guilds, factions, or other groups? Make a list of the rival's assets and how they can be used.\r\n\r\n### Example Rival: Brogg Chak\r\nThe Chak clan is a small but powerful family of geonosians traders in the city, but years ago, they pulled up stakes and left overnight. Brogg Chak, the youngest scion, has now returned to restore his family's prestige.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the family fled because its members had been evading the city's requisite taxes. A corrupt official who was an ally informed the family that a raid on their business was going to be conducted, so they fled the city and began operating as smugglers. After climbing the ranks of their smuggling ring, Brogg�along with a small army of followers�has returned to claim his place among the elite of his former home city. He vows that he will succeed, or leave the city in ruins.\r\n\r\n#### Goals\r\nBrogg wants to become the most respected and most important merchant in town�someone to whom even the governing body must yield.\r\n\r\n#### Plans\r\nBrogg plans to discredit and ruin other merchants. His allies spy on his opponents, disrupting their trade routes, stealing their wares, and causing minor chaos. Brogg disrupts his own warehouses to avoid suspicion.\r\n\r\nIf Brogg's plan fails, he intends to use his forces to assassinate as much of the ruling body as possible, as well as his merchant peers.\r\n\r\n##### Brogg's Plans\r\n|Element|Description|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|Event|Renegade droids become a noticeable problem in the city. Folk demand that action be taken.|\r\n|Action|Supply raids become more common, and common folk talk of gathering a militia. Brogg contributes to the effort.|\r\n|Action|Warehouses are burned down, ruining tens of thousands of credits worth of goods. Brogg blames the city for lax response times.|\r\n|Event|An electrical storm strikes the city, overriding and destroying many droids and constructs.|\r\n|Action|Brogg spreads rumors that the characters or other rivals in town are responsible for the increased crime.|\r\n\r\n#### Assets\r\nBrogg has a small fortune, some noteworthy skills in espionage, and a substantial following that is dedicated to him.\r\n\r\n## Bounty Hunting\r\nOne of the galaxy's oldest professions, bounty hunting is a lucrative�but dangerous�activity that is held in great esteem by adventurers.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nBounty hunting requires one workweek and at least 500 cr spent on materials, bribes, gifts, and other expenses. Spending more money increases your chance of successfully collecting your bounty, as shown in Resolution.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nAfter one workweek, the character makes a Wisdom (Survival) check, with a +1 bonus per 500 cr spent beyond the initial 500 cr, up to a maximum bonus of +5. The character then consults the Bounty Hunting Roll Modifier table below.\r\n\r\n##### Bounty Hunting Roll Modifier\r\n|Ability Check DC|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|10|+5|\r\n|15|+10|\r\n|20|+15|\r\n|25|+20|\r\n|30|+25|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Bounty Hunting Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nOnce the player has determined their bounty hunting roll modifier, they then roll percentile dice and consult the Bounty Hunting Results table below.\r\n\r\n##### Bounty Hunting Results\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |You fail to catch your target.|\r\n|41-70        |You fail to catch your target, but stumble across a lesser bounty, earning 500 cr|\r\n|71-100       |You catch your target, resulting in a 1,000 cr bounty|\r\n|101-110      |You catch a high-value target, resulting in a 2,500 cr bounty.|\r\n|111 or higher|You catch a kingpin, resulting in a 10,000 cr bounty and a nickname.|\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nBounty hunting is a dangerous profession that involves interaction with many seedy and nefarious characters, and targets rarely go willingly. Consequently, each workweek spent bounty hunting brings a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Bounty Hunting Complications\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|Your quarry swears up-and-down that you've got the wrong person.|\r\n|2|Your target manages to escape after you've collected your bounty, and they are coming for you.|\r\n|3|Your target was very valuable to a crime boss, and they've sworn to take revenge on you.|\r\n|4|Your target had connections with an esteemed noble family, and they're publicly besmirching you.|\r\n|5|Your target was a high-ranking member of a guild. You've earned their ire.|\r\n|6|Another bounty hunter was also on the hunt. You just barely beat them, and they're not happy.|\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nBounty hunting is another activity that many characters will find attractive, but it is better executed using the three pillars of adventuring. The GM can determine that complications arise, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Buying Enhanced Items\r\nPurchasing an enhanced item requires time and money to seek out and contact people willing to sell items. Even then, there is no guarantee a seller will have the items a character desires.\r\n\r\nA character looking to purchase a standard, premium, prototype, advanced, or possibly legendary enhanced item can spend downtime searching for a seller. The downtime activity can be performed only in a city or another location where one can find individuals interested in parting with enhanced items. Artifact enhanced items can't be purchased during downtime. Finding such an item can be the substance of an adventure in and of itself.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nFinding enhanced items to purchase requires at least five days of effort and 1,000 cr in expenses. Spending more time and money increases your chance of finding a high-quality item, as shown in Resolution.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nA character seeking to buy an enhanced item makes an Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine the rarity of the item found. The character gains a +1 bonus on the check for every five days beyond the first that are spent seeking a seller, and a +1 bonus for every additional 1,000 cr spent on the search, up to a maximum bonus of +10. The monetary cost includes a wealthy lifestyle, for a buyer must impresses potential business partners.\r\n\r\nIf the characters seek a specific enhanced item, have them make the check twice. If both checks succeed, they find a seller with the specific enhanced item. Otherwise, use the lower of the two rolls to determine what rarity item they find for sale.\r\n\r\nThe result of the check determines the rarity of the item for sale, as shown below in the Purchasable Enhanced Item table.\r\n\r\n##### Purchasable Enhanced Items\r\n|Rarity|DC to Find Seller|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|\r\n|Standard|10|+10|\r\n|Premium|15|+0|\r\n|Prototype|20|-10|\r\n|Advanced|25|-20|\r\n|Legendary|30|-30|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Buying an Enhanced Item table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nOnce a seller is found, the player rolls percentile dice and consults the Buying an Enhanced Item table below, applying a modifier based on the item's rarity, as shown in the Purchaseable Enhanced Items table. \r\n\r\nYou determine a seller's identity. Seller sometimes move prototype, advanced, and legendary items through proxies to ensure that their identities remain unknown. \r\n\r\n> As a further option to reflect the availability of enhanced items in your campaign, you can apply up to a -10 penalty for a scarce setting, or up to a +10 bonus for a setting where enhanced items are more common, when resolving the d100 roll for buying enhanced items, as appropriate. \r\n\r\n##### Buying an Enhanced Item\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |A seller asking five times the item's value, or a shady seller asking two and a half times the item's value.|\r\n|41-70        |A seller asking twice the item's value, or a shady seller asking the full item's value.|\r\n|71-100       |A seller asking the full item's value.|\r\n|101-110      |A shady seller asking half the item's value, no questions asked.|\r\n|111 or higher|A seller asking half the item's value, and a favor.|\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nThe buying and selling of enhanced items is fraught with peril. The large sums of money involved and the power offered by enhanced items attract thieves, con artists, and other villains. If the characters encounter a shady seller, they have a 50 percent chance of triggering a complication. Otherwise, they have a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Buying Complications\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|The item is a fake.|\r\n|2|The item is stolen after purchase.|\r\n|3|The item is a relic cursed by a dark entity.|\r\n|4|The item's original owner will kill to reclaim it; the party's enemies spread news of the transaction.|\r\n|5|The other party is murdered before the transaction is completed.|\r\n|6|A third party enters the transaction, doubling the price.|\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nThe GM can determine whether or not buying enhanced items can be performed during uptime.\r\n\r\n## Carousing\r\nCarousing is a default downtime activity for many characters. Between adventures, who doesn't want to relax with a few drinks and a group of friends at a cantina?\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nCarousing covers a workweek of fine food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class people. Carousing with the lower-, middle-, or upper-class costs 100, 500, or 2,500 cr for the workweek, respectively.\r\n\r\nA character with an appropriate background, such as noble, can easily mingle with the upper class, but other characters can only do so if you judge that character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character might use a disguise kit to pass as a noble visiting from a distant city.\r\n\r\n> If the player elects to disguise themselves, they must make a Charisma (Deception) check instead of a Charisma (Persuasion) check during Resolution.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nAfter a workweek of carousing, a character stands to make contacts within the selected social class. The character makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check, and consults the Carousing Roll Modifier table below:\r\n\r\n##### Carousing Roll Modifier\r\n|Ability Check DC|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|10|+5|\r\n|15|+10|\r\n|20|+15|\r\n|25|+20|\r\n|30|+25|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Carousing Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nOnce the player has determined their carousing roll modifier, they then roll percentile dice and consult the Carousing Results table below.\r\n\r\n##### Carousing Results\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |You make a hostile contact.|\r\n|41-70        |You make no new contacts.|\r\n|71-100       |You make an allied contact.|\r\n|101-110      |You make two allied contacts.|\r\n|111 or higher|You make three allied contacts.|\r\n\r\nContacts are NPCs who now share a bond with the character. Each one either owes the character a favor or has some reason to hold a grudge. A hostile contact works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or violent act, possibly even developing into a rival. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but not at the risk of their lives.\r\n\r\nLower-class contacts include criminals, laborers, mercenaries, a guardsman, or any other folk who normally frequent the chepeast cantina in town.\r\n\r\nMiddle-class contacts include guild members, town officials, merchants, and other folk who frequent well-kept establishments.\r\n\r\nUpper-class contacts are the nobles, elite, and their personal servants. Carousing with such folk covers formal banquets, state dinners, and the like.\r\n\r\nOnce a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC's good graces. A contact provides help only once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, which can influence roleplaying and how the characters interact with them, but doesn't come with a guarantee of help.\r\n\r\nYou can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might decide that the barkeep in some wretched hovel and a guard stationed at a city gate are the character's allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if that character doesn't come into play.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can allow the player to make an NPC into a contact on the spot, after carousing. When the characters are in the same area in which they caroused, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character caroused. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game. \r\n\r\nUsing a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts while giving players the freedom to ensure that the contacts they accumulate are useful.\r\n\r\nThe same process can apply to hostile contacts. You can give the character's a specific NPC they should avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or dramatic moment.\r\n\r\nAt any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Specific, named contacts don't count toward this limit�only ones that can be used at any time to declare an NPC as a contact.\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nCharacters who carouse risk bar brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and building a bad reputation around town. Every workweek spent carousing brings a 10 percent chance of a triggering a complication.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nPlayers can actively engage in carousing using the following rules.\r\n\r\n#### Resources\r\nCarousing covers fine food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class people. Carousing with the lower-, middle-, or upper-class costs 20, 100, or 500 cr, respectively.\r\n\r\nA character with an appropriate background, such as noble, can easily mingle with the upper class, but other characters can only do so if you judge that character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character might use a disguise kit to pass as a noble visiting from a distant city.\r\n\r\n> If the player elects to disguise themselves, they must make Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (disguise kit) checks instead of Charisma (Persuasion) checks during Resolution.\r\n\r\n#### Resolution\r\nThe character then makes five DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) checks. Once you've resolved all five checks, consult the Carousing Results (Uptime) table below.\r\n\r\n##### Carousing Results (Uptime)\r\n|Successes|Result|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|0 successes|You are ejected from the establishment, making two or more hostile contacts.|\r\n|1 success  |You make a hostile contact.|\r\n|2 successes|You make no new contacts.|\r\n|3 successes|You make an allied contact.|\r\n|4 successes|You make two allied contacts.|\r\n|5 successes|You make three allied contacts.|\r\n\r\n#### Complications\r\nCharacters who carouse risk bar brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and building a bad reputation around town. For each failure during Resolution, you have a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Lower-Class Carousing Complications\r\n|d8|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|A pickpocket lifts 1d10 x 50 cr from you.|\r\n|2|A bar brawl leaves you with a scar.|\r\n|3|You have fuzzy memories of doing something very, very illegal, but you can't remember exactly what.|\r\n|4|You are banned from a cantina for some obnoxious behavior.|\r\n|5|After a few drinks, you swore in a public place to pursue a dangerous quest.|\r\n|6|Surprise! You're married.|\r\n|7|Streaking naked through the streets seemed like a great idea at the time.|\r\n|8|Everyone is calling you by some weird, embarrassing nickname, like Puddle Drinker or Bench Slayer, and no one will say why.|\r\n\r\n##### Middle-Class Carousing Complications\r\n|d8|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|You accidentally insulted a guild master, and only a public apology will let you do business with the guild again.|\r\n|2|You swore to complete some quest on behalf of a guild.|\r\n|3|A particularly obnoxious person has taken an intense romantic interest in you.|\r\n|4|A social gaffe has made you the talk of the town.|\r\n|5|You have made a foe out of a local bounty hunter.|\r\n|6|You have been recruited to help run a local festival, play, or similar event.|\r\n|7|You made a drunken toast that scandalized the locals.|\r\n|8|You spent an additional 1,000 cr trying to impress people.|\r\n\r\n##### Upper-Class Carousing Complications\r\n|d8|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|A pushy noble family wants to marry off one of their scions to you.|\r\n|2|You tripped and fell during a dance, and people can't stop talking about it.|\r\n|3|You have agreed to take on a noble's debts.|\r\n|4|You have been challenged to a duel by an embarrassed nobleman.|\r\n|5|You have made a foe out of a local noble.|\r\n|6|A boring noble insists you visit each day and listen to long, tedious expositions on lineage.|\r\n|7|You have become the target of a variety of embarrassing rumors.|\r\n|8|You spent an additional 5,000 cr trying to impress people.|\r\n\r\n## Crafting\r\nA character who has the time, money, and necessary tools can use downtime to craft all sorts of equipment.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nUnlike other downtime activities, crafting takes a varying amount of time based on the value of the item being crafted. Crafting requires the tools appropriate to the item being crafted, as shown in the Item Specific Tools table on page \\-\\-\\-. The character also needs raw materials equal to half of the item's value. To determine how many days it takes to create an item, divide its value by 250. More experienced craftsmen can craft at a faster rate. A character can complete multiple items at a time if the items' combined value no greater than twice the craftsman's crafting rate. Items that cost more than 500 cr can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.\r\n\r\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Use your judgment when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item. A tiny item, like a hold-out, might allow only one or two workers, whereas a large, complex item, like a speeder, might allow four or more workers.\r\n\r\n#### Crafting Enhanced Items\r\nCreating an enhanced item requires more than just time, effort, and materials. It is a long-term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the knowledge needed to create the item. To start with, a character needs a blueprint for an enhanced item in order to create it. The blueprint is like a recipe; it lists the materials needed and steps required to make an item.\r\n\r\nAn item invariably requires a rare material to complete it. This material can range from a specific resource found only in the swamps of Dagobah, or the pearl of a krayt dragon. Finding the material should take place as part of an adventure.\r\n\r\nThe Enhanced Item Ingredients table below suggests the challenge rating of a creature the character needs to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that character needs access to.\r\n\r\n##### Enhanced Item Ingredients\r\n|Rarity|CR Range|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|\r\n|Standard|1-3|+10|\r\n|Premium|4-7|+0|\r\n|Prototype|8-11|-10|\r\n|Advanced|12-14|-20|\r\n|Legendary|15-18|-30|\r\n|Artifact|19+|-40|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Crafting Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nIn addition to facing a specific creature, creating an item comes with a credit cost covering other materials, tools, and so on, equal to half the item's value. If all the above requirements are met, the character can attempt to craft the object.\r\n\r\n> Consider waiving the rare ingredients for item modifications and consumables of standard and premium rarity.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nAfter collecting all the necessary resources and spending the requisite amount of time, a character potentially crafts the item(s). For each item being crafted, the character makes an Intelligence check with the appropriate artisan's tools, and consults the Crafting Roll Modifier table below. If multiple craftsmen worked on the item, use the ability scores and relevant proficiencies for the most skilled amongst them.\r\n\r\n##### Crafting Roll Modifier\r\n|Ability Check DC|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|10|+5|\r\n|15|+10|\r\n|20|+15|\r\n|25|+20|\r\n|30|+25|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Crafting Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nFor each item being crafted, the player rolls percentile dice and consults the Crafting Results table below, applying a modifier based on the item's rarity, as shown in the Enhanced Item Ingredients table above.\r\n\r\n##### Crafting Results\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |You inefficiently craft the item, expending twice the requisite raw materials.|\r\n|41-70        |You inefficiently craft the item, expending one and a half times the requisite raw materials.|\r\n|71-100       |You craft the item with no significant issue.|\r\n|101-110      |You efficiently craft the item, using only half the requisite materials*.|\r\n|111 or higher|You expertly craft the item, using only one-quarter the requisite materials*.|\r\n\r\n> \\*If the item required a rare material, you also used a reduced amount of that material.\r\n\r\n### Crafting Complications\r\nMost of the complications involved in creating something, especially an enhanced item, are linked to the difficulty in finding rare ingredients or components needed to complete the work. The complications a character might face as byproducts of the creation process are most interesting when the characters are working on an enhanced item. Every workweek spent crafting brings a 10 percent chance of a triggering a complication.\r\n\r\n##### Crafting Complications\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|Rumors swirl that what you're working on is unstable and a threat to the community.|\r\n|2|Your tools are stolen, forcing you to buy new ones.|\r\n|3|An affluent craftsman shows keen interest in your work and insists on observing you.|\r\n|4|A powerful wealthy individual offers a heft price for your work and is not interested in hearing no for an answer.|\r\n|5|A noteworthy craftsman accuses you of stealing its secret knowledge to fuel your work.|\r\n|6|A competitor spreads rumors that your work is shoddy and prone to failure.|\r\n\r\n> This is another great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nDue to the required time involved in crafting, it is best suited to downtime. However, characters can work on items in small increments, such as during a short rest, provided they have their tools and their work readily available and unspoiled.\r\n\r\n### Experimenting\r\nIf a character has resources and wants to experiment in crafting an item, using tools with which they are proficient, they can attempt to participate in this variant of this downtime activity.\r\n\r\n#### Resources\r\nThe character should first choose a rarity for which they want to experiment. If experimenting with enhanced items, they should have an appropriate rare material. The character needs raw materials equal to half the maximum value of that item's rarity, as shown in the Enhanced Item Value by Rarity table on page \\-\\-\\-. If experimenting with artifact quality, the value should be assumed to be 1,000,000 cr. For instance, if experimenting with a premium quality item, the value should be treated as 5,000 cr. \r\n\r\n#### Resolution\r\nOnce experimenting is completed, the character should make an Intelligence check with the appropriate artisan's tools with disadvantage, and consult the Crafting Roll Modifier table. If the player fails to meet a DC, no item is crafted, but all materials are expended. The player should then roll percentile dice twice, taking the lesser value, and adding the appropriate modifier \r\n\r\nfrom the Enhanced Item Ingredients table, and then consult the Crafting Results table. At the end of resolution, unless the character fails to meet a DC, they learn a blueprint for an item and craft the item. The GM can choose an item, or determine it randomly.\r\n\r\n#### Complications\r\nComplications occur as normal during crafting.\r\n\r\n### Learning Blueprints\r\nThroughout their adventures, characters might discover blueprints that teach them the recipes to make specific items. If the character has the appropriate tools, they can spend 10 minutes studying the blueprint. If they do so, they must make an Intelligence check with those tools to attempt to learn the blueprint. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the item the blueprint is for, as shown below in the Blueprint Learning DC by Rarity table.\r\n\r\n##### Blueprint Learning DC by Rarity\r\n|Rarity|Blueprint Learning DC|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|Standard|10|\r\n|Premium|14|\r\n|Prototype|18|\r\n|Advanced|22|\r\n|Legendary|26|\r\n|Artifact|30|\r\n\r\nOn a success, the blueprint is learned. On a failure, the blueprint is not learned, and you must wait 24 hours before you can try again.\r\n\r\n### Reverse Engineering\r\nMany tools have the option to reverse engineer a crafted item to learn how to make it themselves. Over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest, a character can carefully disassemble an enhanced item. If they do so, they must make an Intelligence check with the appropriate tools. The DC for the check is determined by the rarity of the item being reverse engineered, as shown below in the Reverse Engineering DC by Rarity table.\r\n\r\n##### Reverse Engineer DC by Rarity\r\n|Rarity|Reverse Engineer DC|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|Standard|15|\r\n|Premium|19|\r\n|Prototype|23|\r\n|Advanced|27|\r\n|Legendary|31|\r\n|Artifact|35|\r\n\r\nOn a success, the item is broken down to half of its raw materials (any rare components are destroyed), and the blueprint for the item is learned. On a failure, the item is destroyed with no recoverable components, and the blueprint is not learned.\r\n\r\n## Crime\r\nSometimes it pays to be bad. This activity gives a character the chance to make some extra cash, at the risk of arrest.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nA character must spend one workweek and at least 250 cr gathering information on potential targets before committing the intended crime.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nThe character must make at least one, but up to three checks, and then consult the Crime Roll Modifier table below. If the character makes more than one check, they can choose the highest value amongst all checks made. However, for each check made beyond the first, the DC for each tier increases by 5. The player can choose to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand), Dexterity (Stealth), Intelligence (forgery kit), Intelligence (security kit), or Intelligence (slicer's kit) check, as appropriate to the crime they attempt. Each check can only be made once.\r\n\r\n##### Crime Roll Modifier\r\n|Ability Check DC|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|10|+5|\r\n|15|+10|\r\n|20|+15|\r\n|25|+20|\r\n|30|+25|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Crime Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the character makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check, and the result is 23, they can elect to keep that check, resulting in +15 crime roll modifier. If the character makes an Intelligence (security kit) check, and the result is a 6, however, they can choose to then make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If the result of that check is a 19, and the character elects to keep it, they receive a +5 crime roll modifier, since the DC for each tier increased by 5 after the first check. If the character elects to make three checks, with the results being 8, 9, and 17, however, they fail to meet a DC, since the DC for each tier increased by 5 for each subsequent check. In this instance, since they failed to meet a DC, they are caught and jailed.\r\n\r\nOnce the player has determined their crime roll modifier, they then roll percentile dice and consult the Crime Results table below.\r\n\r\n##### Crime Results\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |The robbery fails, but you escape.|\r\n|41-70        |You earn 500 cr by robbing a struggling merchant.|\r\n|71-100       |You earn 1,000 cr by robbing a prosperous figure.|\r\n|101-110      |You earn 2,500 cr by robbing a noble.|\r\n|111 or higher|You earn 10,000 cr by robbing one of the richest figures in town.|\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nA life of crime is filled with complications. A character committing a crime has a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication. They have an additional 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each check made during Resolution beyond the first.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Crime Complications\r\n|d8|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|A bounty equal to your earnings is offered for information about your crime.|\r\n|2|An unknown person contacts you, threatening to reveal your crime if you don't render a service.|\r\n|3|Your victim is financially ruined by your crime.|\r\n|4|Someone who knows of your crime has been arrested on an unrelated matter.|\r\n|5|Your loot is a single, easily identifiable item that you can't fence in this region.|\r\n|6|You robbed someone under the protection of a local crime lord, who now wants revenge.|\r\n|7|Your victim calls in a favor from a guard, doubling the efforts to solve the case.|\r\n|8|Your victim asks one of your adventuring companions to solve the crime.|\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nWhile crime is a very fun and engaging activity for a character to participate in, it is better executed using the three pillars of adventuring. The GM can determine that complications arise, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Espionage\r\nThe galaxy is a vast place with many secrets to be uncovered. Between missions, many adventurers may want to spend their downtime engaging in espionage, uncovering the galaxies secrets.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nEspionage requires one workweek finding leads, bribing guards, and infiltrating clandestine locations. A character can attempt to spy on lower-, middle-, or upper-class people. Spying on lower-, middle-, or upper-class costs 100, 500, or 2,500 cr for the workweek, respectively.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nThe character must make at least one, but up to three checks, and then consult the Espionage Roll Modifier table below. If the character makes more than one check, they can choose the highest value amongst all checks made. However, for each check made beyond the first, the DC for each tier increases by 5. The player can choose to make a Charisma (Deception), Dexterity (Stealth), or Intelligence (slicer's kit) check. Each check can only be made once.\r\n\r\n##### Espionage Roll Modifier\r\n|Ability Check DC|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|10|+5|\r\n|15|+10|\r\n|20|+15|\r\n|25|+20|\r\n|30|+25|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Espionage Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the character makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check, and the result is 21, they can elect to keep that check, resulting in +15 crime roll modifier. If the character makes an Intelligence (slicer's kit) check, and the result is a 3, however, they can choose to then make a Charisma (Deception) check. If the result of that check is a 17, and the character elects to keep it, they receive a +5 crime roll modifier, since the DC for each tier increased by 5 after the first check. If the character elects to make three checks, with the results being 4, 7, and 13, however, they fail to meet a DC, since the DC for each tier increased by 5 for each subsequent check. In this instance, since they failed to meet a DC, they are caught and jailed.\r\n\r\nOnce the player has determined their espionage roll modifier, they then roll percentile dice and consult the Espionage Results table below.\r\n\r\n##### Espionage Results\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |You fail to find any useful information with which to blackmail, and your face is clearly identified.|\r\n|41-70        |You find no useful information.|\r\n|71-100       |You find information with which to blackmail one person.|\r\n|101-110      |You find information with which to blackmail two people.|\r\n|111 or higher|You find information with which to blackmail three people.|\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nBlackmail is information that can be used to coerce an activity from an NPC. Blackmail can come in a variety of forms, and the value of the blackmail varies depending on how important the subject of the information is and to whom it has value.\r\n\r\nLower-class blackmail includes the secrets of criminals, laborers, mercenaries, guardsmen; anyone you might find a cheap cantina.\r\n\r\nMiddle-class blackmail includes the secrets of faction members, town officials, merchants, and people who frequent well-kept establishments.\r\n\r\nUpper-class blackmail covers the secrets of the nobles and elite.\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nEspionage is fraught with peril. A character who engages in espionage has a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication. They have an additional 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each check made during Resolution beyond the first.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Espionage Complications\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|A bounty equal to the credits spent is offered for information about your crime.|\r\n|2|An unknown person contacts you, threatening to reveal your activities if you don't render a service.|\r\n|3|Your victim asks one of your adventuring companions to solve the crime.|\r\n|4|Someone who knows of your activities has been arrested on an unrelated matter.|\r\n|5|Your victim calls in a favor from a guard, doubling the efforts to solve the case.|\r\n|6|You blackmailed someone under the protection of a local crime lord, who now wants revenge.|\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nWhile spying is a very fun and engaging activity for a character to participate in, it is better executed using the three pillars of adventuring. The GM can determine that complications arise, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Gambling\r\nGames of chance are a great way to make a fortune, and a better way to lose one.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nThis activity requires one workweek of effort, plus a stake of at least 100 cr to a maximum of 10,000 cr, or more as you see fit. Alternatively, you could allow characters to bet with things other than money.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nThe character must make at least one, but up to three checks, and then consult the Gambling Roll Modifier table below. If the character makes more than one check, they can choose the highest value amongst all checks made. However, for each check made beyond the first, the DC for each tier increases by 5. The player can choose to make a Charisma (Deception), Intelligence check with the appropriate gaming set, or Wisdom (Insight) check. If the character is not proficient in the gaming set, they can not make a Charisma (Deception) or Wisdom (Insight) check. Each check can only be made once.\r\n\r\n##### Gambling Roll Modifier\r\n|Ability Check DC|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|10|+5|\r\n|15|+10|\r\n|20|+15|\r\n|25|+20|\r\n|30|+25|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Gambling Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the character makes an Intelligence (sabaac deck) check, and the result is an 18, they can elect to keep that check, resulting in a +10 gambling roll modifier. If the result of the check was only 4, however, they can choose to then make a Charisma (Deception) check. If the result of that check is a 22, and the character elects to keep it, they receive a +10 gambling roll modifier, since the DC for each tier increased by 5 after the first check. If the character makes an Intelligence (sabaac deck) check with a result of 8, a Charisma (Deception) check with a result of 13, and finally a Wisdom (Insight) check, with a result of 11, they fail to meet a DC, since the DC for each tier increased by 5 for each subsequent check. In this instance, they lose their entire stake, and accrue a debt equal to that amount. This debt can be paid immediately if the character has the requisite funds after losing their stake.\r\n\r\nOnce the player has determined their gambling roll modifier, they then roll percentile dice and consult the Gambling Results table below.\r\n\r\n##### Gambling Results\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |You lose your entire stake.|\r\n|41-70        |You lose half your stake.|\r\n|71-100       |You break even. Not bad.|\r\n|101-110      |You win an amount equal to your stake.|\r\n|111 or higher|You win an amount equal to three times your stake.|\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nGambling tends to attract unsavory individuals. The potential complications involved come from run-ins with the law and associations with various criminals tied to the activity. Every workweek spent gambling brings a 10 percent chance of a triggering a complication. They have an additional 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each check made during Resolution beyond the first.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Gambling Complications\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|You are accused of cheating. You decide whether you did cheat or were framed.|\r\n|2|The town guards raid the gambling hall and throw you in jail.|\r\n|3|A noble in town loses badly to you and loudly vows to get revenge.|\r\n|4|You won a sum from a low-ranking member of a nefarious guild, and the guild wants it money back.|\r\n|5|A local crime boss insists you start frequenting their gambling parlor, and no others.|\r\n|6|A high-stakes gambler comes to town and insists that you take part in a game.|\r\n\r\n> #### Variant: Gambling Spectator\r\n> Occasionally, rather than participate themselves, your characters might want to gamble on a game or event in which someone else is involved. In that case, the character can instead make a Wisdom (Insight) check. If they do so, they do not have the opportunity to make subsequent checks.\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nPlayers can actively engage in gambling using the following rules.\r\n\r\n#### Resources\r\nThis activity requires a stake of at least 20 cr to a maximum of 2,000 cr, or more as you see fit. Alternatively, you could allow characters to bet with things other than money.\r\n\r\n#### Resolution\r\nThe character must make five checks. \r\n\r\nIf playing against the house, the player makes a DC 20 Intelligence check with the appropriate gaming set. Once you've resolved all five checks, consult the Gambling Results (Uptime) table below.\r\n\r\nIf playing against an opponent, the player can choose to make a Charisma (Deception), Intelligence check with the appropriate gaming set, or Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the opponent. If there are multiple opponents, use the ability scores and relevant proficiencies for the most skilled amongst them. For each check the character makes, the opponent also makes a check, with an additional effect based on what choices were made.\r\n- If the character chooses to make a Charisma (Deception) check, they have advantage on the check if the opponent makes an Intelligence (gaming set) check, and disadvantage on the check if the opponent makes a Wisdom (Insight) check. If the opponent also makes a Charisma (Deception) check, both checks are made normally.\r\n- If the character chooses to make an Intelligence (gaming set) check, they have advantage on the check if the opponent makes a Wisdom (Insight) check, and disadvantage on the check if the opponent makes a Charisma (Deception) check. If the opponent also makes an Intelligence (gaming set) check, both checks are made normally.\r\n- If the character chooses to make a Wisdom (Insight) check, they have advantage on the check if the opponent makes a Charisma (Deception) check, and disadvantage on the check if the opponent makes an Intelligence (gaming set) check. If the opponent also makes a Wisdom (Insight) check, both checks are made normally.\r\n\r\nThis advantage and disadvantage occurs for both the character and the opponent. For instance, if the character chooses to make a Charisma (Deception) check, and the opponent choose to make an Intelligence (gaming set) check, the character has advantage on their check, while the opponent has disadvantage on theirs. In the event of a tie, the character and opponent should reroll the contest. If the character is not proficient in the gaming set, they can not make a Charisma (Deception) or Wisdom (Insight) check. Once you've resolved all five checks, consult the Gambling Results (Uptime) table below.\r\n\r\n> When determining what action the opponent takes, the GM can choose or determine the choice randomly.\r\n\r\n##### Gambling Results (Uptime)\r\n|Successes|Result|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|0 successes|You lose your entire stake, and accrue a debt equal to that amount.|\r\n|1 success  |You lose your entire stake.|\r\n|2 successes|You lose half your stake.|\r\n|3 successes|You break even. Not bad.|\r\n|4 successes|You win an amount equal to your stake.|\r\n|5 successes|You win an amount equal to three times your stake.|\r\n\r\n#### Complications\r\nGambling tends to attract unsavory individuals. The potential complications involved come from run-ins with the law and associations with various criminals tied to the activity. For each success during Resolution, you have a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Gambling Complications (Uptime)\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|You are accused of cheating. You decide whether you did cheat or were framed.|\r\n|2|The town guards raid the gambling hall.|\r\n|3|A noble in town loses badly to you and loudly vows to get revenge.|\r\n|4|You won a sum from a low-ranking member of a nefarious guild, and the guild wants it money back.|\r\n|5|A local crime boss insists you start frequenting their gambling parlor, and no others.|\r\n|6|A high-stakes gambler insists that you take part in a game.|\r\n\r\n> #### Variant: Gambling Spectator\r\n> Occasionally, rather than participate themselves, your characters might want to gamble on a game or event in which someone else is involved. In that case, the character can instead make five Wisdom (Insight) check. \r\n\r\n## Mercenary Contracting\r\nOften, traditional work doesn't appeal to adventurers, who crave a little more excitement, even during their offweeks. Those characters might prefer to engage in mercenary work.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nWorking as a mercenary requires one week of downtime, as well as 100 credits to seek out an available job.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nThe character must make at least one, but up to three ability checks as appropriate to the contract they take. The GM might call for a Charisma (Intimidation) check if the character as working as an enforcer, a Strength (Athletics) check if working as a guard, or an Intelligence (Investigation) check if the character is working as a detective. If the character makes more than one check, they can choose the highest value amongst all checks made. However, for each check made beyond the first, the DC for each tier increases by 5. \r\n\r\n##### Mercenary Contracting Roll Modifier\r\n|Ability Check DC|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|10|+5|\r\n|15|+10|\r\n|20|+15|\r\n|25|+20|\r\n|30|+25|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Mercenary Contracting Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the character makes a Charisma (Intimidation) check, and the result is 20, they can elect to keep that check, resulting in +15 mercenary contracting roll modifier. If the character makes an Intelligence (Investigation) check, and the result is a 4, however, they can choose to repeat the check. If the result of that check is a 16, and the character elects to keep it, they receive a +5 mercenary contracting roll modifier, since the DC for each tier increased by 5 after the first check. If the character elects to make three checks, with the results being 9, 10, and 18, however, they fail to meet a DC, since the DC for each tier increased by 5 for each subsequent check. In this instance, since they failed to meet a DC, they fail to find a job.\r\n\r\nOnce the player has determined their mercenary contracting roll modifier, they then roll percentile dice and consult the Mercenary Contract Results table below.\r\n\r\n##### Mercenary Contracting Results\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |The character finds a job, but fails to complete it successfully and goes unpaid.|\r\n|41-70        |You complete a relatively simple job, earning 250 cr.|\r\n|71-100       |You complete a moderately difficult job, earning 500 cr.|\r\n|101-110      |You complete an exceptionally difficult task, earning 1,250 cr.|\r\n|111 or higher|You complete an insanely difficult task, earning 5,000 cr and a favor from your employer.|\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nMercenary work varies drastically in how eventful it can be. A character spending a week mercenary contracting has a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication. They have an additional 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each check made during Resolution beyond the first.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Mercenary Contracting Complications\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|You manage to offend a bystander with an innocuous comment, and it turns out they're important.|\r\n|2|You have a run-in with the law.|\r\n|3|You beat out another individual who wanted your job, earning their ire.|\r\n|4|Your boss works for a local criminal organization, and insists you perform further work for them.|\r\n|5|Another person offers to pay you to fail in your task.|\r\n|6|You are forced into a physical altercation, resulting in a scar.|\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nWhile mercenary contracting is a common endeavor in any campaign, it is better executed using the three pillars of adventuring. The GM can determine that complications arise, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Pit Fighting\r\nPit fighting includes boxing, wrestling, and other nonlethal forms of combat in an organized setting with predetermined matches. If you want to introduce competitive fighting in a battle-to-the-death situation, the standard combat rules apply, rather than downtime.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nEngaging in this activity requires one workweek of effort from a character.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nThe character must make at least one, but up to three checks, and then consult the Pit Fighting Roll Modifier table below. If the character makes more than one check, they can choose the highest value amongst all checks made. However, for each check made beyond the first, the DC for each tier increases by 5. The player can choose to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check. Alternatively, the character can instead make an attack roll using one of the character's weapons. Each check can only be made once.\r\n\r\n##### Pit Fighting Roll Modifier\r\n|Ability Check DC|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|10|+5|\r\n|15|+10|\r\n|20|+15|\r\n|25|+20|\r\n|30|+25|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Pit Fighting Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the character makes a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check, and the result is an 27, they can elect to keep that check, resulting in a +20 pit fighting roll modifier. If the result of the check was only 9, however, they can choose to then make an attack roll with one of their weapons. If the result of that attack roll is a 24, and the character elects to keep it, they receive a +10 pit fighting roll modifier, since the DC for each tier increased by 5 after the first check. If the character makes an Strength (Athletics) check with a result of 11, a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check with a result of 14, and finally an attack roll with one of their weapons, with a result of 18, they fail to meet a DC, since the DC for each tier increased by 5 for each subsequent check. In this instance, they lose all of their bouts, and suffer one level of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nOnce the player has determined their pit fighting roll modifier, they then roll percentile dice and consult the Pit Fighting Results table below.\r\n\r\n##### Pit Fighting Results\r\n|d100|You Find...|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |You lose all of your bouts.|\r\n|41-70        |You win some of your bouts, earning 250 cr.|\r\n|71-100       |You win half of your bouts, earning 500 cr.|\r\n|101-110      |You win most of your bouts, earning 1,500 cr.|\r\n|111 or higher|You go undefeated, earning 5,000 cr and a title recognized by the people of this town.|\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nCharacters involved in pit fighting must deal with their opponents, the people who bet on matches, and the matches' promoters. Every workweek spent pit fighting brings a 10 percent chance per success of triggering a complication. They have an additional 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each check made during Resolution beyond the first.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Pit Fighting Complications\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|An opponent swears to take revenge on you.|\r\n|2|A crime boss approaches you and offers to pay you to intentionally lose a few matches.|\r\n|3|You defeat a popular local champion, drawing the crowd's ire.|\r\n|4|You defeat a noble's servant, drawing the wrath of the noble's house.|\r\n|5|You are accused of cheating. Whether the allegation is true or not, your reputation is tarnished.|\r\n|6|You accidentally deliver a near fatal wound to an opponent.|\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nWhile pit fighting is a very fun and engaging activity for a character to participate in, it should be executed using the normal rules of combat. For each round victory, a character should receive winning determined by the GM. The GM can also determine that complications arise, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Racing\r\nOn many worlds, racing is a popular local pastime. For the accomplished pilot, racing is a great way to make credits and a name for yourself. However, racing is not for the faint of heart.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nThis activity requires one workweek of effort and a 250 cr entry fee. If the character does not own an appropriate vehicle, they can rent one for 1,000 cr.\r\n\r\n### Resolution \r\nThe character must make at least one, but up to three checks, and then consult the Racing Roll Modifier table below. If the character makes more than one check, they can choose the highest value amongst all checks made. However, for each check made beyond the first, the DC for each tier increases by 5. The player can choose to make an Intelligence (mechanic's kit), Intelligence (Piloting), or Intelligence (Technology) check. If the character is not proficient in Piloting, they can not make an Intelligence (mechanic's kit) or Intelligence (Technology) check. Each check can only be made once.\r\n\r\n##### Racing Roll Modifier\r\n|Ability Check DC|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|10|+5|\r\n|15|+10|\r\n|20|+15|\r\n|25|+20|\r\n|30|+25|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Racing Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the character makes an Intelligence (Piloting) check, and the result is a 17, they can elect to keep that check, resulting in a +10 racing roll modifier. If the result of the check was only 7, however, they can choose to then make a Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check. If the result of that check is a 24, and the character elects to keep it, they receive a +10 racing roll modifier, since the DC for each tier increased by 5 after the first check. If the character makes an Intelligence (Technology) check with a result of 9, an Intelligence (Piloting) check with a result of 9, and finally a Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check, with a result of 9, they fail to meet a DC, since the DC for each tier increased by 5 for each subsequent check. In this instance, they lose all of their races and crash their vehicle, requiring at least 1,000 cr in repairs to fix.\r\n\r\nOnce the player has determined their racing roll modifier, they then roll percentile dice and consult the Racing Results table below.\r\n\r\n##### Racing Results\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |You lose all of your races.|\r\n|41-70        |You win some of your races, earning 500 cr.|\r\n|71-100       |You win half of your races, earning 1,000 cr.|\r\n|101-110      |You win most of your races, earning 2,500 cr.|\r\n|111 or higher|You go undefeated, earning 10,000 cr and a title recognized by the people of this town.|\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nRacing attracts many different kinds of individuals: from arrogant racers to manipulative managers, adoring fans to obsessive critics. The potential complications can vary from vehicular trouble to perceived slights. Every workweek spent racing brings a 10 percent chance of a triggering a complication. They have an additional 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each check made during Resolution beyond the first.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Racing Complications\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|You side-swipe another racer, earning their ire.|\r\n|2|A crime boss approaches you and offers to pay you to intentionally lose a few races.|\r\n|3|You are accused of cheating. Whether the allegation is true or not, your reputation is tarnished.|\r\n|4|You beat a low-ranking member of a nefarious guild, and the guild isn't happy.|\r\n|5|A local crime boss insists you start racing for them, and no others.|\r\n|6|A renowned racer comes to town and insists on a race.|\r\n\r\n> #### Variant: Animal Racing\r\n> You may encounter an arena in which they race animals instead of vehicles. In this instance, you'll want to substitute Intelligence (Nature), Wisdom (Animal Handling), and Wisdom (Survival) for Intelligence (mechanic's kit), Intelligence (Piloting), and Intelligence (Technology), respectively.\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nPlayers can actively engage in racing using the following rules.\r\n\r\n#### Resources\r\nThis activity requires a 50 cr entry fee. If the character does not own an appropriate vehicle, they can rent one for 200 cr.\r\n\r\n#### Resolution\r\nThe character must make five checks. \r\n\r\nIf racing against a time, the player makes a DC 20 Intelligence (Piloting) check. Once you've resolved all five checks, consult the Racing Results (Uptime) table below.\r\n\r\nIf racing against an opponent, the player can choose to make an Intelligence (mechanic's kit), Intelligence (Piloting), or Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the opponent. If there are multiple opponents, use the ability scores and relevant proficiencies for the most skilled amongst them. For each check the character makes, the opponent also makes a check, with an additional effect based on what choices were made.\r\n- If the character chooses to make an Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check, they have advantage on the check if the opponent makes an Intelligence (Piloting) check, and disadvantage on the check if the opponent makes an Intelligence (Technology) check. If the opponent also makes an Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check, both checks are made normally.\r\n- If the character chooses to make an Intelligence (Piloting) check, they have advantage on the check if the opponent makes an Intelligence (Technology) check, and disadvantage on the check if the opponent makes an Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check. If the opponent also makes an Intelligence (Piloting) check, both checks are made normally.\r\n- If the character chooses to make an Intelligence (Technology) check, they have advantage on the check if the opponent makes an Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check, and disadvantage on the check if the opponent makes an Intelligence (Piloting) check. If the opponent also makes an Intelligence (Technology) check, both checks are made normally.\r\n\r\nThis advantage and disadvantage occurs for both the character and the opponent. For instance, if the character chooses to make an Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check, and the opponent choose to make an Intelligence (Piloting) check, the character has advantage on their check, while the opponent has disadvantage on theirs. In the event of a tie, the character and opponent should reroll the contest. If the character is not proficient Piloting, they can not make an Intelligence (mechanic's kit) or Intelligence (Technology) check. Once you've resolved all five checks, consult the Racing Results (Uptime) table below.\r\n\r\n> When determining what action the opponent takes, the GM can choose or determine the choice randomly.\r\n\r\n##### Racing Results (Uptime)\r\n|Successes|Result|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|0 successes|You lose your race and crash your vehicle, requiring at least 1,000 cr in repairs to fix.|\r\n|1 success  |You lose your race.|\r\n|2 successes|You just fail to place, but manage to earn 100 cr.|\r\n|3 successes|You take 3rd place, earning 200 cr.|\r\n|4 successes|You take 2nd place, earning 500 cr.|\r\n|5 successes|You take 1st place, earning 2,000 cr.|\r\n\r\n#### Complications\r\nRacing attracts many different kinds of individuals: from arrogant racers to manipulative managers, adoring fans to obsessive critics. The potential complications can vary from vehicular trouble to perceived slights. For each success during Resolution, you have a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Racing Complications (Uptime)\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|You side-swipe another racer, earning their ire.|\r\n|2|A crime boss approaches you and offers to pay you to intentionally lose a few races.|\r\n|3|You are accused of cheating. Whether the allegation is true or not, your reputation is tarnished.|\r\n|4|You beat a low-ranking member of a nefarious guild, and the guild isn't happy.|\r\n|5|A local crime boss insists you start racing for them, and no others.|\r\n|6|A renowned racer insists on a race.|\r\n\r\n## Research\r\nTo be forewarned is to be forearmed. This activity allows a character to delve into lore concerning a monster, a location, an enhanced item, or some other specific topic.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nTypically, a character needs access to a library or some other academic institution to conduct research. Assuming such access is available, conducting research requires one workweek and at least 500 cr spent on materials, bribes, gifts, and other expenses. Spending more money increases your chances of finding noteworthy lore, as shown in Resolution.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nThe character declares the focus of the research�a specific person, place, or thing. After one workweek, the character makes an Intelligence (Lore) check, with a +1 bonus per 1,000 cr spent beyond the initial 500 cr, up to a maximum bonus of +5. The character then consults the Research Roll Modifier table below.\r\n\r\n##### Research Roll Modifier\r\n|Ability Check DC|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|10|+5|\r\n|15|+10|\r\n|20|+15|\r\n|25|+20|\r\n|30|+25|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Research Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nOnce the player has determined their research roll modifier, they then roll percentile dice and consult the Research Results table below.\r\n\r\n##### Research Results\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |You learn nothing.|\r\n|41-70        |You learn one piece of lore.|\r\n|71-100       |You learn two pieces of lore.|\r\n|101-110      |You learn three pieces of lore.|\r\n|111 or higher|You learn five pieces of lore, as well as the relative location of an item worth at least 5,000 cr.|\r\n\r\nEach piece of lore is the equivalent of one true statement about a person, place, or thing. Examples include knowledge of a creature's resistances, the method required to enter a sealed tomb, or the clandestine knowledge held by a specific person.\r\n\r\nAs GM, you are the final arbiter concerning exactly what a character learns. For a monster or an NPC, you can reveal elements of statistics or personality. For a location, you can reveal secrets about it, such as a hidden entrance, the answer to a riddle, or the nature of a creature that guards the place.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can allow the player to determine what lore they've learned on the spot, after research. When the characters are in an area related to what was researched, a player can expend a lore to uncover something related to the location on hand, assuming it pertains to what was researched. \r\n\r\nUsing a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific lore while giving players the freedom to ensure that the lore they learn is useful.\r\n\r\nAt any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified lore equal to 1 + the character's Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). Specific, learned lore doesn't count toward this limit�only ones that can be used at any time to learn something related to the original subject of study.\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nThe greatest risk in research is uncovering false information. Not all lore is accurate or truthful, and a rival with a scholarly bent might try to lead the character astray, especially if the object of the research is known to the rival. The rival might plant false information, bribe scholars to give bad advice, or steal key information needed to find the truth.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a character might run into other complications during research. Every workweek spent in research brings a 10 percent chance of a triggering a complication. \r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Research Complications\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|You accidentally damage a rare, fragile source of information.|\r\n|2|You offend a scholar, who demands an extravagant gift.|\r\n|3|If you had known the source of information was cursed, you never would have opened it.|\r\n|4|A scholar becomes obsessed with convincing you of a number of strange theories.|\r\n|5|Your actions cause you to be banned from a library or some other academic institution.|\r\n|6|You uncovered useful lore, but only by promising to complete a dangerous task in return.|\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nConducting research is generally a long-term activity, requiring time and devotion, best suited to downtime. \r\n\r\n## Selling Enhanced Items\r\nFew people can afford to buy an enhanced item, and fewer still know how to find one. Adventurers are exceptional in this regard due to the nature of their profession.\r\n\r\nA character who comes into possession of a standard, premium, prototype, advanced, or possibly legendary enhanced item that he or she wants to sell can spend downtime searching for a buyer. The downtime activity can be performed only in a city or another location where one can find wealthy individuals interested in acquiring enhanced items. Artifact enhanced items can't be sold during downtime. Finding someone to buy such an item can be the substance of an adventure in and of itself.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nFinding a buyer for a standard, premium, prototype, advanced, or legendary enhanced item takes up to twenty days of effort, depending on the rarity of the enhanced item for sale, and costs 100 cr per day.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nFor each salable item, the character must make a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find buyers. Another character can use his or her downtime to assist with the search, granting advantage on the check. \r\n\r\nOn a failure, no buyer for the item is found after a search that lasts a number of days equal to the maximum for that item's rarity, as shown below in the Days to Find Buyer column of the Salable Enhanced Items table below. On a success, a buyer for the item is found after a number of days based on the item's rarity, as shown below in the Salable Enhanced Item table.\r\n\r\n##### Salable Enhanced Items\r\n|Rarity|Days to Find Buyer|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|\r\n|Standard|1d4|+10|\r\n|Premium|1d6|+0|\r\n|Prototype|1d8|-10|\r\n|Advanced|1d10|-20|\r\n|Legendary|1d20|-30|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Selling an Enhanced Item table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nA character can attempt to find buyers for multiple enhanced items at once. Although this requires multiple Intelligence (Investigation) checks, the searches are occurring simultaneously, and the results of multiple failures or successes aren't added together. For example, if the character finds a buyer for a standard enhanced item in 2 days and a buyer for a premium enhanced item in 5 days, but fails to find a buyer for a prototype enhanced item, the entire search takes 8 days.\r\n\r\nFor each item a character wishes to sell, the player rolls percentile dice and consults the Selling an Enhanced Item table below, applying a modifier based on the item's rarity, as shown in the Salable Enhanced Items table. The subsequent total determines what a buyer offers to pay for the item.\r\n\r\nYou determine a buyer's identity. Buyers sometimes procure prototype, advanced, and legendary items through proxies to ensure that their identities remain unknown.\r\n\r\n> As a further option to reflect the availability of enhanced items in your campaign, you can apply up to a -10 penalty for a scarce setting, or up to a +10 bonus for a setting where enhanced items are more common, when resolving the d100 roll for selling enhanced items, as appropriate. \r\n\r\n##### Selling an Enhanced Item\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |A buyer offering one-quarter of the item's value, or a shady buyer offering half the item's value.|\r\n|41-70        |A buyer offering half the item's value, or a shady buyer offering the full item's value.|\r\n|71-100       |A buyer offering the full item's value.|\r\n|101-110      |A shady buyer offering one and a half times the item's value, no questions asked.|\r\n|111 or higher|A buyer offering one and a half times the item's value, but they also want a favor.|\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nThe buying and selling of enhanced items is fraught with peril. The large sums of money involved and the power offered by enhanced items attract thieves, con artists, and other villains. If the characters encounter a shady buyer, they have a 50 percent chance of triggering a complication. Otherwise, they have a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Selling Complications\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|The item is perceived as a fake.|\r\n|2|The item is stolen before the sale.|\r\n|3|The item is a relic cursed by a dark entity.|\r\n|4|The item's original owner will kill to reclaim it; the party's enemies spread news of the transaction.|\r\n|5|The other party is murdered before the transaction is completed.|\r\n|6|A third party enters the transaction, offering an alternative item.|\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nThe GM can determine whether or not selling enhanced items can be performed during uptime.\r\n\r\n## Training\r\nGiven enough time, money, and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language, pick up proficiency with a tool or kit, gain proficiency or even expertise in a skill, or possibly even earn a feat.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nReceiving training requires you first find a teacher who is willing and capable of teaching you. It then takes a varying amount of time and credits, depending on what you're training in. Costs are paid at the beginning of each workweek.\r\n\r\n#### Language or Weapon\r\nLearning a new language or training in a new weapon takes 10 workweeks and costs 250 cr per workweek. During resolution, training in a language calls for an Intelligence check, while a weapon requires an attack roll with that weapon. If you are proficient in that saving throw, you add your proficiency bonus to the roll.\r\n\r\n#### Tool Training, Proficiency, or Expertise\r\nLearning to use a new tool takes 5, 10, or 20 workweeks for training, proficiency, or expertise, respectively and costs the value of the tool in cr per workweek. During resolution, training in a new tool calls for an ability check appropriate to that tool, as determined by the GM. If you are proficient in that saving throw, you add your proficiency bonus to the roll.\r\n\r\n#### Skill Training, Proficiency, or Expertise\r\nLearning a new skill takes 5, 10, or 20 workweeks and costs at least 250 cr, 500 cr, or 1,000 cr per workweek for training, proficiency, or expertise, respectively. During resolution, training in a new skill calls for an ability check with that skill's governing ability score. If you are proficient in that saving throw, you add your proficiency bonus to the roll.\r\n\r\n#### Saving Throw Training or Proficiency\r\nLearning a new saving throw takes 10 or 20 workweeks and costs 750 cr or 1,500 cr per workweek for training or proficiency, respectively. During resolution, training in a new saving throw calls for an ability check with that saving throw's governing ability score.\r\n\r\n#### Feat\r\nLearning a new feat takes 40 workweeks and costs at least 2,000 cr per workweek. During resolution, training in a new feat calls for an ability check appropriate to that feat, as determined by the GM. If you are proficient in that saving throw, you add your proficiency bonus to the roll.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nAt the end of each workweek, a character makes an ability check depending on their training, and then consults the Training Roll Modifier table.\r\n\r\n##### Training Roll Modifier\r\n|Ability Check DC|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|10|+5|\r\n|15|+10|\r\n|20|+15|\r\n|25|+20|\r\n|30|+25|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Training Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\nOnce the player has determined their training roll modifier, they then roll percentile dice and consult the Training Results table below.\r\n\r\n##### Training Results\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |Your training falters, advancing only half a workweek towards completion.|\r\n|41-70        |Your training is adequate, advancing one workweek towards completion.|\r\n|71-100       |Your training has a breakthrough, advancing two workweeks towards completion.|\r\n|101-110      |Your training is excellent, advancing three workweeks towards completion.|\r\n|111 or higher|Your training is masterful, advancing four workweeks towards completion.|\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nComplications that arise while training typically involve the teacher. For every five workweeks spent in training, or for each failure during resolution, a character has a 10 percent chance of a complication. Examples of which are on the Training Complications table.\r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Training Complications\r\n|d6|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|Your earn the ire of another of the teacher's students.|\r\n|2|Your teacher instructs you in rare, archaic methods, which draw comments from others.|\r\n|3|Your teacher is a spy sent to learn your plans.|\r\n|4|Your teacher is a wanted criminal.|\r\n|5|Your teacher is a cruel taskmaster.|\r\n|6|Your teacher asks for help dealing with a threat.|\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nDue to the required time involved in training, it is best suited to downtime.\r\n\r\n## Work\r\nWhen all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nTaking on a job requires one workweek of work.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nThe character must make an ability check as appropriate to the job they are trying to perform. The GM might call for a Strength (Athletics) check if the character is working with their hands, an Intelligence check with a set of tools if the character is working as a tradesman, a Charisma (Performance) check if the character is working in a speaking capacity, a Charisma check with a musical instrument if the character is performing in a venue, or any other check the GM deems appropriate. Once the character has made their chosen check, they should consult the Work Roll Modifier table below.\r\n\r\n##### Work Roll Modifier\r\n|Ability Check DC|d100 Roll Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|10|+5|\r\n|15|+10|\r\n|20|+15|\r\n|25|+20|\r\n|30|+25|\r\n\r\n> The **d100 Roll Modifier** is added to the percentile dice rolled for the Work Results table, which is discussed below.\r\n\r\n##### Work Results\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|40 or lower  |You earn enough to support a poor lifestyle for the week, with 10 cr left over.|\r\n|41-70        |You earn enough to support a modest lifestyle for the week, with 50 cr left over.|\r\n|71-100       |You earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle for the week, with 100 cr left over.|\r\n|101-110      |You earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle for the week, with 200 cr left over.|\r\n|111 or higher|You somehow earn enough to support an aristocratic lifestyle for the week, with 500 cr left over.|\r\n\r\n### Complications\r\nDespite what should be an uneventful, satisfying week of simple work, complications can arise from this activity. A character spending a week working has a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication. \r\n\r\n> This is a great opportunity to create a rival to the party, or involve a previous rival.\r\n\r\n##### Work Complications\r\n|d8|Complication|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|You manage to outperform someone who has been working longer than you, and they're not impressed.|\r\n|2|You bump a coworker in a clearly accidental fashion, but they blow it out of proportion, causing everyone to dislike you.|\r\n|3|A patron asks for a service not provided by your workplace, and asks for the manager when you try to explain this.|\r\n|4|Your manager takes credit for the work you are doing, asserting it is their own.|\r\n|5|One of your coworkers slows down their workload so you have to pick up their slack.|\r\n|6|You sustain a small injury, resulting in a scar.|\r\n|7|Your coworkers, as a group, tell your boss a series of baseless lies. Your boss believes them over you.|\r\n|8|Your coworkers bestow a nickname on you based on an obscure, mundane thing you did or said. They no longer call you by your name.|\r\n\r\n### Uptime\r\nIf you are the type who prefers to hoard their wealth and work for their dinner, you can engage in work during uptime. \r\n\r\n#### Resources\r\nTaking on a job requires at least one hour of work.\r\n\r\n#### Resolution\r\nMake an ability check appropriate to the work you are doing and consult the Work Results (Uptime) table below.\r\n\r\n##### Work Results (Uptime)\r\n|AbilityCheck DC|Result|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|10|You earn enough to support a poor lifestyle for night, with 2 cr left over.|\r\n|15|You earn enough to support a modest lifestyle for night, with 10 cr left over.|\r\n|20|You earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle for night, with 20 cr left over.|\r\n|25|You earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle for night, with 40 cr left over.|\r\n|30|You earn enough to support a aristocratic lifestyle for night, with 100 cr left over.|\r\n\r\n#### Complications\r\nYou have a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication. If you fail to meet an ability check DC, you instead have a one-hundred percent chance of triggering a complication.","contentTypeEnum":0,"contentType":"None","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"2","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Equipment","chapterNumber":5,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 5: Equipment\r\n\r\nThe cities of *Star Wars* are diverse and multicultural, varying dramatically by planet and system. Commonplace activities in one city might be taboo in another. The most common species on one planet might be shunned on the next one. Every city, in addition to the climate and cultures, varies dramatically in the options available for sale.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those options available in the *Player's Handbook*, adventurers might encounter new and interesting wares. On some planets, and in some cultures, armor is made from unique materials that grant it interesting properties. On other planets, a more diverse armory might be available for purchase�or theft. In other places still, interesting and unique adventuring implements might be discovered.\r\n\r\n#### Starting Equipment\r\nWhen choosing the starting equipment for your class, you might have an option to choose any of a certain type of item. For instance, berserkers get a choice of \"*(a)* a martial vibroweapon and a light or medium physical shield or *(b)* two martial vibroweapons\". When choosing starting equipment in this fashion, the items available in this chapter should not be included. However, if you use instead use the Variant: Starting Wealth by Class rule, the items in this chapter should be considered available for purchase.\r\n\r\n#### Ammunition\r\nBlasters that deal energy or ion damage use power cells, while blasters that deal kinetic damage use slug cartridges. This chapter introduces blasters that deal new damage types: acid, fire, and sonic. These weapons also use power cells.\r\n\r\n### Buying and Selling Treasure\r\nThis chapter introduces armor, weapons, adventuring gear, and other valuable materials. Like those options found in the *Player's Handbook*, selling these items should generally be possible, provided they are unspoiled. \r\n\r\n#### Enhanced Items\r\nEnhanced items are scarce and powerful, leading to them rarely having a predetermined price. Buying and selling enhanced items can rarely be performed easily, often requiring extensive time and credits to find a potential buyer and seller. \r\n\r\n#### Rare Materials\r\nWhile rare materials, as the name indicates, are more scarce than their raw material counterparts, they typically have a commonly accepted value across markets. While they won't always be available for sale, they will usually fetch the same price across worlds.\r\n\r\n## Armor and Shields\r\nAdventuring through the different worlds of *Star Wars* shows limitless variety across cultures, varying drastically by their values and technological availability. Many cultures create similar items, but using different materials, granting their items a unique flair. The Armor table shows some examples of how commonly available types of armor found in the game differ, depending on the materials used.\r\n\r\nThe Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of these types of armor worn in the worlds of *Star Wars*.\r\n\r\n### Armor and Shield Proficiency\r\nAnyone can put on a suit of armor or wield a shield. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't force- or tech-cast.\r\n\r\nIf you have proficiency in armor, you have proficiency in the appropriate shield as well.\r\n\r\n### Armor Class (AC)\r\nArmor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your Armor Class.\r\n\r\n### Armor Materials\r\nIn addition to form and function, armor varies greatly based on material. Beyond those standard materials universally available to armor, you might find armor made with more specialized and scarce materials. Armor made with these materials offers a unique strength, but also a weakness. Additionally, the armor's cost increases by an amount, based on the armor's type, as shown in the Armor Type Cost Increase table below:\r\n\r\n##### Armor Type Cost Increase\r\n\r\n|Armor Type|Cost Increase|\r\n|:--|--:|\r\n|Light armor|1,000 cr|\r\n|Medium armor|2,000 cr|\r\n|Heavy armor|6,000 cr|\r\n\r\n|Armor Type|Cost Increase|\r\n|:--|--:|\r\n|Light shield|250 cr|\r\n|Medium shield|750 cr|\r\n|Heavy shield|1,500 cr|\r\n\r\nOnly physical shields can be crafted using alternative armor materials. Additionally, barding can be created using alternative armor materials.\r\n\r\n#### Multiple Materials\r\nArmor and shields can be made using an amalgam of materials. Doing so increases the cost of the armor or shield for each material used in its creation, and the number of materials used can't exceed half the crafter's proficiency bonus, rounded up.\r\n\r\n#### Beskar\r\nArmor and shields made from beskar gains the regulated property, but also the strength 11 property. If the armor or shield would already have the strength property, instead increase the strength number by 2.\r\n\r\n#### Bone\r\nBone armor and shields have the barbed (1d4) and spiked (1d4) properties, respectively, but suffer a -1 penalty to Armor Class.\r\n\r\n#### Crystadium\r\nArmor and shields made from crystadium has the absorptive 1 property, but also the rigid and imbalanced properties, respectively.\r\n\r\n#### Durafiber\r\nDurafiber armor and shields have their strength number reduced by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If the strength number is 11, this removes the strength property from it entirely. If the armor or shield lacks the strength property, it instead gains the lightweight property. Additionally, durafiber armor and shields suffer a -1 penalty to Armor Class. \r\n\r\n#### Duranium\r\nArmor and shields made from duranium gain the reactive 1 and responsive 1 properties, respectively, but also the cumbersome property.\r\n\r\n#### Durasteel\r\nDurasteel armor has the impermeable 2 and rigid properties. Durasteel shields have the interlocking and imbalanced properties.\r\n\r\n#### Duravlex \r\nArmor and shields made from duravlex have the silent and concealing properties, respectively, but suffer a -1 penalty to Armor Class.\r\n\r\n#### Fleximetal\r\nFleximetal armor and shields gain the avoidant 1 property, but also the strength 11 property. If the armor or shield would already have the strength property, instead increase the strength number by 2.\r\n\r\n#### Laminanium\r\nArmor and shields made from laminanium gain the obscured and lambent properties, respectively, but also the cumbersome property.\r\n\r\n#### Neutronium\r\nNeutronium armor and shields gain the insulated 1 property, but also the strength 11 property. If the armor or shield would already have the strength property, instead increase the strength number by 2.\r\n\r\n#### Plastoid\r\nArmor made from plastoid has the reinforced and rigid properties. Shields made from plastoid have the anchor and imbalanced properties.\r\n\r\n#### Quadanium\r\nQuadanium armor and shields gain the charging 1 property, but also the cumbersome property.\r\n\r\n### Armor Properties\r\nMany armors and shield have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Armor table. You must be proficient in and wearing armor or wielding a shield to benefit from its special properties.\r\n\r\n#### Absorptive\r\nWhen you are wearing armor or wielding a shield with this property, damage that you take from weapons is reduced by an amount equal to the absorptive number. If this would reduce the damage to 0, the damage is instead reduced to 1.\r\n\r\n#### Agile\r\nWhile wearing armor or wielding a shield with this property, your Dexterity score becomes equal to the agile number. If your Dexterity is already equal to or greater than the agile number, it has no effect on you.\r\n\r\n#### Anchor\r\nA shield with this property can be used to provide cover. As an action, you can anchor or recover the shield. While anchored, you gain no benefit from a shield, and it does not require the use of a hand. Instead, while anchored, a light shield provides one-quarter cover, a medium shield provides half cover, and a heavy shield provides three-quarters cover.\r\n\r\n#### Avoidant\r\nWhen wearing armor or wielding a shield with this property and a creature makes an attack against you, the critical hit range decreases by an amount equal to the avoidant number, to a minimum of 1.\r\n\r\n#### Barbed\r\nWhen you succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check to initiate or maintain a grapple while wearing armor with this property, the creature takes kinetic damage using the barbed damage (which appears in parentheses with the property) + your Strength modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Charging\r\nWhen you take damage while wearing armor or wielding a shield with this property, you gain a charge. You can store a maximum number of charges equal to the charging number, and the charges last for 1 minute. The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack while you have charges, you deal additional damage of the same type as the weapon's damage equal to the number of charges stored, and the charges are expended.\r\n\r\n#### Concealing\r\nWhile wielding a shield with this property, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sight.\r\n\r\n#### Cumbersome\r\nWhile wearing armor or wielding a shield with this property, your speed is reduced by 5.\r\n\r\n#### Gauntleted\r\nWhile wearing armor with this property, your unarmed strikes deal kinetic damage using the gauntleted damage (which appears in parentheses with the property) + your Strength modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Imbalanced\r\nWhen you are critically hit while wielding a shield with this property, you can't take reactions until the start of your next turn, and you gain no AC benefit from your shield against the next attack against you before the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Impermeable 2\r\nArmor with this property includes the limited functions of a number of enviromental suits equal the impermeable number from the list below, which are either included in parentheses with the property or determined by the GM.

If your Dexterity modifier is negative, you instead subtract the full modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Silent\r\nWhile wearing armor with this property, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sound.\r\n\r\n#### Spiked\r\nWhen you succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check to shove or trip a creature while wielding a shield with this property, the creature takes kinetic damage using the spiked damage (which appears in parentheses with the property) + your Strength modifier. If you use a shield with this property as an improvised weapon, the damage increases by one step (from d4 to d6, d6 to d8, or d8 to 2d4).\r\n\r\n#### Steadfast \r\nWhile wearing armor or wielding a shield with this property, you have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws to avoid being moved.\r\n\r\n#### Versatile\r\nA shield with this property can be used with one or two hands.

Your weapon proficiencies reflect the tools you are most likely to use. The Weapons tables show additional weapons used in the worlds of *Star Wars*, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. \r\n\r\n### Weapon Proficiency\r\nYour species, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The three types of weapons�blaster, lightweapon, and vibroweapon, are further broken down into two categories�simple and martial. Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.\r\n\r\nProficiency in these weapons is discussed further in Chapter 6.\r\n\r\n### Weapon Properties\r\nMany weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.\r\n\r\n#### Biting\r\nThis weapon's damage becomes acid. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack with a weapon with the biting property, you can instead force the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon, or the biting number, whichever is lower). If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit, and the first attack it makes before the end of its next turn has disadvantage. If damage dealt by this weapon reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.\r\n\r\n#### Bright\r\nThis weapon's damage becomes fire, and its luminous property sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet while activated, instead of only dim light in a 5-foot radius. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack with a weapon with the bright property, you can instead force the target to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon, or the bright number, whichever is lower). If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit, and the creature takes additional damage of the same type at the start of its next turn equal to your governing ability modifier.\r\n\r\n#### Brutal\r\nWhen you score a critical hit with a weapon with the brutal property, you roll a number of additional weapon damage dice equal to the brutal number.\r\n\r\n#### Corruption\r\nThis weapon's damage becomes necrotic, and it loses the luminous property if it has it. Additionally, when you would make a melee weapon attack with a weapon with the corruption property, you can instead force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon, or the corruption number, whichever is lower). If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes normal weapon damage and is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit, and the creature cannot regain hit points until the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Defensive\r\nWhen you make your first attack on your turn with a weapon with the defensive property, you can choose to suffer a penalty to attack and damage rolls with that weapon up to the defensive number. If you do so, you gain the same bonus to AC. These effects last until the start of your next turn, as long as you're holding the weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Dire\r\nBefore you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the dire property, you can choose to suffer a penalty to the attack roll up to the dire number. If you do so and you hit with it, you gain an equivalent bonus to the damage roll.\r\n\r\n#### Disarming\r\nWhen you score a critical hit with a weapon with the disarming property against a creature that is holding an object, you can attempt to disarm the target (no action required). If the target is no more than one size larger than you (your size or smaller if your weapon has the light property), it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or it drops an object of your choice at its feet.\r\n\r\n#### Disintegrate\r\nWhen a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by a weapon with the disintegrate property, it must make a Constitution saving throw, DC equal to the disintegrate number. On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything unenhanced it is wearing or carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized.\r\n\r\n#### Disruptive\r\nWhen a creature is forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration due to taking damage from a weapon with the disruptive property, the DC for the check equals 10 or the full damage taken, whichever number is higher, instead of only half.\r\n\r\n#### Keen\r\nWhen you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the keen property, the critical hit range increases by an amount equal to the keen number.\r\n\r\n#### Mighty\r\nWhen making an attack with a mighty weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.\r\n\r\n#### Neuralizing\r\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon with the neuralizing property, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, DC equal to the neuralizing number. On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 1d4 psychic damage and becomes frightened of you until the start of its next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Piercing\r\nBefore you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the piercing property, you can choose to gain a bonus to the attack roll up to the piercing number. If you do so and you hit with it, you suffer an equivalent penalty to the damage roll.\r\n\r\n#### Reckless\r\nWhen you make your first attack on your turn with a weapon with the reckless property, you can choose to gain a penalty to AC up to the reckless number. If you do so, you gain the same bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon. These effects last until the start of your next turn, as long as you're holding the weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Shocking\r\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon with the shocking property, you can force it to make a Dexterity saving throw, DC equal to the shocking number. On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 1d4 lightning damage and becomes shocked until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Silent\r\nWhen you make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with the silent property while hidden, it does not automatically reveal your presence. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by your targets' Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, you remain hidden.\r\n\r\n#### Smart\r\nThis weapon ignores your Dexterity score and proficiency bonus. Two numbers appear in parentheses with the property�the first is the weapon's Dexterity score, and the second is the weapon's proficiency bonus. The weapon uses these values instead of yours when you make attack and damage rolls with it. If you lack proficiency with the weapon, the weapon does not benefit from its proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Sonorous\r\nWhen you hit a creature with a weapon with the sonorous property, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw, DC equal to the sonorous number. On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 1d4 sonic damage and becomes deafened until the end of its next turn.\r\n\r\n#### Switch\r\nA weapon with the switch property can deal an alternate type of damage. A damage value appears in parentheses appears with the property-the damage when the weapon uses its alternate damage type. On your turn, you can use your object interaction to change the weapon's damage type.\r\n\r\n#### Vicious\r\nWhenever you deal damage with a weapon with the vicious property and roll the maximum on a weapon damage die, you gain a bonus to damage equal to the vicious number.\r\n\r\n### Special Weapons\r\nWeapons with special rules are described below.\r\n\r\n#### Flechette Cannon\r\nThe flechette cannon does not make attack rolls. Rather than traditional power cells, the flechette cannon uses specialized projector tanks, which, when fired, spray an area with the contents of the tank. Projector tanks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tank�s effects. It can have different ammunition types loaded simultaneously, and you can choose which ammunition you�re using as you fire it (no action required). If you don�t meet the flechette cannon�s strength requirement, creatures have advantage on their saving throws. If you lack proficiency in the flechette cannon, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.\r\n\r\n#### Grenade Launcher\r\nRather than traditional power cells, the grenade launcher fires grenades. When firing a grenade at long range, or if you don�t meet the grenade launcher�s strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the grenade�s explosion have advantage on the saving throw. If you lack proficiency in the grenade launcher, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.\r\n\r\n#### Rocket Launcher\r\nRather than traditional power cells, the rocket launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of rockets. When firing a rocket at long range, or if you don�t meet the rocket launcher�s strength requirement, creatures within the radius of the rocket�s explosion have advantage on the saving throw.\r\n\r\n#### Shoulder Blaster\r\nMounted by the shoulder slot, a shoulder blaster does not require a free hand to use. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of this weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Shoulder Cannon\r\nMounted by the shoulder slot, a shoulder cannon does not require a free hand to use. Additionally, you have advantage on Strength ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of this weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Vapor Projector\r\nThe vapor projector does not make attack rolls. Rather than traditional power cells, the vapor projector uses specialized projector tanks, which, when fired, spray an area with the contents of the tank. \r\n\r\nProjector tanks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the tank�s effects. It can have different ammunition types loaded simultaneously, and you can choose which ammunition you�re using as you fire it (no action required). If you don�t meet the vapor projector�s strength requirement, creatures have advantage on their saving throws. If you lack proficiency in the vapor projector, you must roll the damage dice twice and take the lesser total.\r\n\r\n##### Blasters\r\n|Name|Cost|Damage|Weight|Properties|

tech-casting, there exist focuses which are used to channel their respective powers. While focus generators are optional for forcecasters, techcasters are required to have a focus in order to cast their powers. Wristpads are traditionally worn on the wrist and do not require a hand to activate, while focus generators generally take the form of a small scepter or crystal that is traditionally held in the hand.\r\n\r\n### Focus Proficiency\r\nUnlike weapons and armor, no proficiency is required to use focuses. Instead, you need the ability to forcecast for focus generators and the ability to techcast for wristpads.\r\n\r\n> #### Variant: Alternative Focuses\r\n> While traditionally there are only two types of focuses�focus generators and wristpads�certain class features and enhanced items unlock the ability to use an alternative item type. If a character wants to use something else as their focus, such as a lightsaber or a heavy shield, consider allowing them to do so. Later in this chapter, you'll find rules to add casting properties to unenhanced focuses. As GM, you can consider extending these rules to weapons and armor, or even tools for your engineer, as you deem appropriate.\r\n> Additionally, there are a significant number of focus generator and wristpad modifications that grant these properties. If a player wants to use an alternative focus, consider allowing them to use focus generator and wristpad modifications to in place of the normal modifications for the item they're using as a focus. If they do so, the DC to install or remove a modification, as shown on page \\_\\_\\_, is increased by 5. You should also consider allowing engineers to install these mods in their archetype focus, even if there is no existing chassis for that item.\r\n\r\n### Casting Properties\r\nSome focuses have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Data Recording and Storage subsection of the Adventuring Gear section.\r\n\r\n#### Absorbing\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, when you take damage from any source, you can reduce that damage by an amount up to the absorptive number, provided you have a number of force or tech points equal to half the damage absorbed. When you do so, you lose half the damage taken in force or tech points.\r\n\r\n#### Accessing\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, you gain access to a number of new powers (chosen by the GM) of a combined total no greater than the access number. The powers count as known by you, and you can't unlearn the powers.\r\n\r\n#### Amplifying\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, your critical hit range with melee force or tech attacks increases by an amount equal to the amplifying number.\r\n\r\n#### Bolstering \r\n_**Prerequisite:** Focus generator property_\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, your maximum force points increase by the bolstering number.\r\n\r\n#### Constitution\r\nWhile using an item with this property as your focus, you gain no benefit from any additional properties the item has unless your Constitution score meets or exceeds the constitution number.\r\n\r\n#### Dispelling\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, your level of proficiency in force- or tech-casting ability checks increases by a number of steps equal to the dispelling number (to trained, from trained to proficient, from proficient to expertise, from expertise to mastery, from mastery to high mastery, or from high mastery to grand mastery).\r\n\r\n#### Elongating \r\nWhile using this item as your focus, when you cast a power that affects a cylinder, the height of the cylinder increases by an amount equal to the elongating number, and the radius of the cylinder increases by an amount equal to half the elongating number.\r\n\r\n#### Enlarging\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, when you cast a power that affects a cube, the length of each side of the cube increases by an amount equal to the enlarging number.\r\n\r\n#### Expanding\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, when you cast a power that affects a cone, the length of that cone increases by an amount equal to the expanding number.\r\n\r\n#### Extending \r\nWhile using this item as your focus, when you cast a power that affects a line, the length of the line increases by an amount equal to the extending number, and the width of the line increases by an amount equal to half the extending number.\r\n\r\n#### Fading\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, the critical fail range of force or tech powers that require a Strength or Constitution saving throw increases by an amount equal to the fading number.\r\n\r\n#### Focused\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, you can't have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration.\r\n\r\n#### Increasing\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, when you cast a power that has a range of 5 feet or greater, the range of that power increases by an amount equal to the increasing number.\r\n\r\n> #### Adding Casting Properties to Focuses\r\n> Each of these properties can be used to create a new unenhanced focus generator wristpad. When generating new focuses for player character use, each positive property should be offset by a level of Constitution, and each property should increase the of the focus by 1,000 cr. This cost scales by the number of properties and it is in addition to the base cost of the time. For instance, a wristpad with one positive property and the Constitution 11 property would cost 1,600 cr (1,000 cr for the positive property + 600 for the base cost of the wristpad). A wristpad with two positive properties and the Constitution 13 property, however, would cost 3,600 cr (1,000 cr for the first property, 2,000 cr for the second property, and 600 for the base cost of the wristpad). GMs can generate new focuses in this way, similar to how the Weapon Calculator can be used to generate new weapons at the discretion of the GM. Unenhanced focuses can't exceed 1 level in a single property.\r\n\r\n#### Inflating \r\nWhile using this item as your focus, when you cast a power that affects a sphere, the radius of the sphere increases by an amount equal to the inflating number.\r\n\r\n#### Mitigating \r\nWhile using this item as your focus, using the Ready action to cast a force or tech power no longer requires concentration. You can only have one instance of this feature active at a time. Additionally, if the power would not be released, and the power was 1st level or higher, the cost of the power is reduced by a number of points equal to the mitigating number, to a minimum of 1.\r\n\r\n#### Ranging\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, your critical hit range with ranged force or tech attacks increases by an amount equal to the ranging number.\r\n\r\n#### Rending\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, the critical fail range of force or tech powers that require a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw increases by an amount equal to the rending number.\r\n\r\n#### Repelling\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, your powers are no longer automatically dispelled or interrupted. Instead, the DC to interrupt or dispel your powers is equal to 10 + the power's level, or 8 + half your proficiency bonus + your casting modifier for that power, whichever is greater.\r\n\r\n#### Storing\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, you can store 1st-level or higher powers of a combined total no greater than the storing number within the focus for later use. You can cast a power into this item while touching it. The power has no effect other than to be stored in the item. If the item can't hold the power, the power is expended without effect. You can cast any power stored in it at its base level, causing the power to no longer be stored, freeing up the space.\r\n\r\n#### Surging \r\n_**Prerequisite:** Wristpad property_\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, your maximum tech points increase by the surging number.\r\n\r\n#### Withering\r\nWhile using this item as your focus, the critical fail range of force or tech powers that require a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw increases by an amount equal to the withering number.\r\n\r\n> #### Variant: Focus Properties and Features\r\n> Many of these properties could affect class features. Consider extending those properties to benefit those features, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Adventuring Gear\r\nThis section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.\r\n\r\n### Ammunition\r\n\r\n#### Corrosive Cartridge\r\nA corrosive cartridge is a specialized slug cartridge for use with blaster weapons that deal kinetic damage.

otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, pick a lock, or slice into a computer. Your species, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. Like skills, proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it. Unlike skills, you must have your tools present in order to make an ability check with them. \r\n\r\nThe table shows examples of some of the most common types of tools. Each tool falls under one of four categories: artisan's implements, gaming sets, musical instruments, or specialist's kits. Each tool requires a separate proficiency. \r\n\r\n#### Artisan's Implements\r\nArtisan's implements are predominantly designed for building and crafting things of permanent nature. Each set of implements focuses on a specific craft. \r\n\r\n***Artist's Implements.*** Artist's implements encompasses any set of tools designed to create art.\r\n\r\n***Audiotech's Implements.*** Audiotech's implements are for crafting and tuning musical instruments.\r\n\r\n***Constructor's Implements.*** Constructor's implements are for creating and fortifying structures.\r\n\r\n***Cybertech's Implements.*** Cybertech's implements are used for crafting and modifying wristpads.\r\n\r\n***Geneticist's Implements.*** Geneticist's implements are for creating and grafting genetic mutations.\r\n\r\n***Jeweler's Implements.*** Jeweler's implements are used to appraise gemstones and create jewelry.\r\n\r\n***Surveyor's Implements.*** Surveyor's implements are used to create both physical and digital maps.\r\n\r\n***Synthweaver's Implements.*** Synthweaver's implements create and modify articles of clothing.\r\n\r\n***Writer's Implements.*** Writer's implements contains everything needed to create and publish physical and digital written works. \r\n\r\n#### Gaming Sets\r\nThis item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and/or decks of cards. A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. \r\n\r\n#### Musical Instruments\r\nSeveral of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. Musical instruments can often be used in place of�or in addition to�a performance.\r\n\r\n#### Specialist's Kits\r\nLike artisan's implements, specialist's kits are need to pursue a craft or trade. Some specialist's kits are used to craft items that are impermanent, such as grenades, medpacs, or poisons while other tools are used to achieve a specific purpose, such as picking locks or creating a disguise.\r\n\r\n***Alchemist's Kit.*** Alchemist's kits contains everything needed to enhance creatures and items with alchemy.\r\n\r\n***Archaeologist Kit.*** Archelogist kits contains instruments used to collect gems and relics. \r\n\r\n***Artillerist's Kit.*** Artillerist's kits contains all the necessary tools to create, repair, and modify turrets. \r\n\r\n***Bioanalysis Kit.*** Bioanalysis kits contains a variety of instruments to harvest and store plants and herbs. \r\n\r\n***Brewer's Kit.*** Brewer's kits contains a variety of devices and containers to adequately distill and house liquors and beers. \r\n\r\n***Munitions Kit.*** Munitions kits contains the necessary tools to create ammunition for blasters, as well as devices to hone lightweapons and vibroweapons.\r\n\r\n***Scavenging Kit.*** Scavenging kits contains the necessary implements to harvest and scavenge ores and metals. \r\n\r\n***Spicer's Kit.*** Spicer's kits contains the required tools to create and refine illicit substances.\r\n\r\n##### Tools\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n|\tItem\t\t|\tCost\t|\tWeight\t|\r\n|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|\t_Artisan's implements_\t\t|\t\t|\t\t|\r\n|\tArtist's implements\t\t\t|\t100 cr\t|\t5.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tAudiotech's implements                    |\t550 cr\t|   7.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tConstructor's implements\t\t|\t 100 cr\t|\t7.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tGeneticist's implements                   |\t900 cr\t|   4.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tJeweler's implements\t\t    |\t250 cr\t|  2.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tSurveyor's implements\t\t\t|\t500 cr\t|\t6.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tSynthweaver's implements\t\t|\t250 cr\t|\t2.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tWriter's implements\t\t|\t200 cr\t|\t3.00 lb\t|\r\n|\t_Gaming set_\t\t|\t\t|\t\t|\r\n|\tChatta-ragul set\t\t\t\t|\t  450 cr\t|\t  11.00 lb \t|\r\n|\tKirgatz set\t\t\t\t|\t  250 cr\t|\t  6.00 lb \t|\r\n|\t_Musical instrument_\t\t|\t\t|\t\t|\r\n|\tBandfill\t\t\t\t\t|\t300 cr\t|\t2.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tChindinkalu horn\t\t\t|\t120 cr\t|\t7.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tFanfar\t\t\t\t\t|\t220 cr\t|\t4.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tFizzz\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t160 cr\t|\t3.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tKloo horn\t\t\t\t\t|\t330 cr\t|\t2.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tMandoviol\t\t\t\t\t|   425 cr\t|   1.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tShawm\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t 20 cr\t|\t1.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tSlitherhorn\t\t\t\t|\t120 cr\t|\t2.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tTraz\t\t\t\t\t    |\t300 cr\t|\t6.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tValahorn\t\t\t\t    |\t340 cr\t|\t4.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tXantha\t\t\t\t    |\t170 cr\t|\t7.00 lb\t|\r\n|\t_Specialist's kit_\t\t|\t\t|\t\t|\r\n|\tAlchemist's kit\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t500 cr\t|\t2.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tArchaeologist kit\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t125 cr\t|\t4.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tArtillerist's kit\t\t\t                |\t275 cr\t|  11.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tBioanalysis kit\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t 50 cr\t|\t3.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tBrewer's kit\t\t\t                    |\t200 cr\t|\t9.00 lb\t|\r\n|   Munitions kit                             |   425 cr  |   6.00 lb    |\r\n|\tScavenging kit\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t 75 cr\t|\t4.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tSpicer's kit\t\t\t                    |\t700 cr\t|\t4.00 lb\t|\r\n\r\n## Trade Goods\r\nTrade is an essential part of the galactic economy. Many spacers make their living buying and selling goods along hyperspace routes that connect the galaxy's major worlds.\r\n\r\nA merchant may be chartered by an individual or a corporation to deliver goods to a certain port, or move goods along a specified route. During times of war, opportunities abound in the shipping of ammunition and medical supplies. Some traders, seeking to earn a quick profit, may resort to smuggling illegal or restricted cargo on behalf of one of the galaxy's many crime syndicates. The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.\r\n\r\n##### Trade Goods\r\n|\tCost\t| \t| Goods\t|\r\n|----: |:--:|:------------ |\r\n|\t 100 cr\t||\tAnimal, common\t|\r\n|\t 500 cr\t||\tAnimal, livestock\t|\r\n|  2,000 cr\t||\tAnimal, uncommon\t|\r\n|\t 100 cr\t||\tArt. common\t|\r\n|  1,000 cr\t||\tArt. quality\t|\r\n| 10,000 cr ||\tArt, precious\t|\r\n|\t 400 cr\t||\tBacta, 1 gal\t|\r\n|\t  10 cr\t||\tFood, common (5 lbs)\t|\r\n|\t  20 cr\t||\tFood. quality (5 lbs)\t|\r\n|\t  50 cr\t||\tFood. exotic (5 lbs)\t|\r\n| 10,000 cr ||\tGems, exotic (1 carat)\t|\r\n|\t 100 cr\t||\tGems, semiprecious (1 carat)\t|\r\n|  1,000 cr\t||\tGems, precious (1 carat)\t|\r\n|\t  10 cr\t||\tHolovid\t|\r\n|  2,500 cr\t||\tMetal, common (1 ton)\t|\r\n|\t 100 cr\t||\tMetal, semi-precious (1 lb)\t|\r\n|  5,000 cr\t||\tMetal, precious (1 lb)\t|\r\n|  1,500 cr\t||\tOre. common (1 ton)\t|\r\n|  2,000 cr\t||\tSpice, common (1 lb)\t|\r\n|  5,000 cr\t||\tSpice, precious (1 lb)\t|\r\n| 10,000 cr ||\tSpice, illicit (1 lb)\t|\r\n\r\n## Substances\r\nSubstances, most commonly coming in the alcohol and spice varieties, are goods often sought after by the more seedy denizens of the *Star Wars* underworld. Whether legal or not, people search for these wares, whether to consume or profit on.\r\n\r\n### Consumption\r\nConsuming substances offers powerful temporary boons in the form of a high, potentially offset by a subsequent low. Additionally, consuming substances regularly risks addiction, which reduces the efficacy of substances until a creature abstains from using them.\r\n\r\n#### Highs and Lows\r\nEach substance offers a high followed immediately by a potential low. For the duration of the high, a creature might gain a bonus to an ability score, temporary force or tech points, or some other boon. Immediately when the high ends, the character must succeed on a saving throw depending on the substance or suffer a longer-lasting low, which reverses the effects. The high and low varies depending on the substance consumed, and the duration of the high and low vary based on the rarity of the substance consumed, as determined in the item's description.\r\n\r\nA creature can only benefit from one substance at a time. If a creature consumes an additional unit of a substance, while currently experiencing a high or a low, they must immediately make a saving throw to resist the effects of addiction before applying the benefits of the consumed substance. Consuming a substance while experiencing a low immediately ends the low, but any time remaining in that low is added to the duration of the low of the additional consumed substance.\r\n\r\n#### Addiction\r\nConsuming substances regularly also risks becoming addicted to a substance. When the low of a substance ends, a creature must make a saving throw, determined by what substance they are coming off of, as determined in the substance's description. Addiction is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of addiction, as specified in the effect's description.\r\n\r\n##### Addiction Level\r\n|Level|Effect|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|The duration of lows is doubled.|\r\n|2|The duration of highs is halved.|\r\n|3|The duration of lows is quadrupled, instead of doubled.|\r\n|4|The effect of highs is halved.|\r\n|5|The effect of lows is maximized.|\r\n|6|The effect of highs is minimized.|\r\n\r\n##### Substances\r\n\r\n|\tItem\t|\tCost\t|\tWeight\t\t|\r\n|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|\t_Alcoholic beverages_\t|\t\t|\t\t\t|\r\n| Deuterium-pyro      |   80 cr  |  .50 lb  |\r\n| Mummergy            |   65 cr  |  .50 lb  |\r\n| Novanian grog       |   70 cr  |  .50 lb  |\r\n| Raava               |   95 cr  |  .50 lb  |\r\n| Spicebrew           |   90 cr  |  .50 lb  |\r\n| Tihaar              |   85 cr  |  .50 lb  |\r\n| Tsiraki             |   60 cr  |  .50 lb  |\r\n| Vayerbok            |   75 cr  |  .50 lb  |\r\n|\t_Spices_\t|\t\t|\t\t\t|\r\n| Andris              |   75 cr  |  .25 lb  |\r\n| Cilona              |   60 cr  |  .25 lb  |\r\n| Giggledust          |   80 cr  |  .25 lb  |\r\n| Glitterstim         |   95 cr  |  .25 lb  |\r\n| Karrak              |   90 cr  |  .25 lb  |\r\n| Muon gold           |   65 cr  |  .25 lb  |\r\n| Yaladai             |   70 cr  |  .25 lb  |\r\n| Yarrock             |   85 cr  |  .25 lb  |\r\n\r\nIf an already addicted creature suffers another effect that causes addiction, its current level of addiction increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.\r\n\r\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of addiction as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 addiction has the duration of its lows doubled, and the duration of its highs halved.\r\n\r\nAn effect that removes addiction reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all addiction effects ending if a creature's addiction level is reduced below 1.\r\n\r\nIf a creature abstains from consuming a substance for 24 hours, they can make a Wisdom saving throw to reduce their addiction level by 1, provided they've completed a long rest during that 24 hours. The DC for the saving throw equals 10 + the creature's addiction level. On a success, their addiction level is reduced by 1. For instance, a creature suffering addiction level 3 can abstain from consuming any substance for 24 hours.

Joining a faction offers unique benefits, as determined by the faction's features.\r\n\r\n## Joining a Faction\r\nA character can join a faction at any time, provided they can find a faction member capable of recruiting and they are not in bad standing with the faction. If a character is in bad standing with a faction that they wish to join, and they can find a nonhostile representative of that faction, they may be able to complete a task to return to the faction's favor, as determined by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for joining a faction vary based on the the faction you are trying to join. The Jedi Order, for instance, might require you to be a certain age and Force-sensitive. The Bounty Broker's Association, however, simply require monthly dues.\r\n\r\n> #### Factions and Backgrounds\r\n> If a character is of an appropriate background, such as Jedi or Guild Merchant, can start at at least 1st rank in their faction, as determined by the GM.\r\n\r\n### Membership Benefits\r\nAs an established and respected member of a faction, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow faction members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a headquarters offers a central place to meet other members of your faction, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.\r\n\r\nFactions often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your faction will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the faction, if you are a member in good standing. Your dues must be current to remain in the faction's good graces.\r\n\r\n### Membership Dues\r\nAfter joining a faction, characters have certain requirements they must meet in order to retain in their faction's good standing. For some factions, it might simply be credit dues paid at the beginning of the month. For other factions, they might require you spend one workweek a month furthering their interests.\r\n\r\n#### Overdue \r\nIf at the end of a month you are not current in your dues, you must become current again before you can gain any benefits from your faction. For every month you are not current in your dues, you must account for the missed dues for each month before you can become current again. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if your faction requires a credit tithe, you must meet the missed tithe for each month before you become current again. If your faction requires a workweek of downtime, however, you must complete a workweek for each month you are behind.\r\n\r\nIf you ever become overdue by a year or more, you lose your membership in that faction entirely unless you can justify that the absence was beyond your control. If you can not justify your absence and you choose to rejoin your faction, you start over at 1st rank.\r\n\r\n### Membership in Multiple Factions\r\nYou can have ranks in multiple factions as long as those factions are not in direct conflict, but your total combined ranks across all your factions can not exceed half your character level (rounded up). If you complete a task that aligns with the goals of one of your factions, but is in direct conflict with another faction, you risk lowing renown with the other faction, or potentially being disavowed entirely.\r\n\r\n### Faction Ranks\r\nFactions can have a maximum of five ranks. While the names and responsibilities of each rank vary by faction, their general structure tends to be the same.\r\n\r\n#### Rank 1: Initiate\r\nThis is the rank a character receives when first joining a faction. \r\n\r\n#### Rank 2: Member\r\nRank 2 characters have shown they're aligned with the faction's goals, allowing greater responsibility.\r\n\r\n#### Rank 3: Veteran\r\nRank 3 characters are reliable faction members, entrusted with many secrets and deserving of additional support.\r\n\r\n#### Rank 4: Officer\r\nRank 4 characters are trusted within the faction's leadership. They are looked up as champions of a faction's endeavors, and are the leaders of individual faction locations.\r\n\r\n#### Rank 5: Leader\r\nRank 5 characters are the leaders of their respective factions. Typically, a faction has one singular leader per headquarters, who delegates responsibilities to the faction's rank 4 and lower characters.\r\n\r\nA faction can not have more rank 5 characters than its tier. If a faction has more than one rank 5 character, typically one stands above the rest.\r\n\r\n### Rising through the Ranks\r\nWhen a character completes an endeavor, such as a downtime activity or mission, that aligns with the goals of their faction, they gain renown. As a character reaches certain thresholds of renown, they earn the opportunity to rise through the ranks of their faction, provided they meet any other requirements, as shown in the Membership Ranks table on page \\-\\-\\-.\r\n\r\n## Factions\r\nFaction can vary greatly in size and renown, from a lowly local adventurer's guild to a galaxy-spanning criminal organization. The nature of factions drastically differ as well, depending on the faction's intended focus. \r\n\r\n### Faction Tiers\r\nFactions vary in tier depending on their size. Smaller factions will typically hover between tier 1 and tier 5, while larger, galaxy-spanning factions might reach tier 20. Higher tiers require more active members, but grant greater benefits to them, as shown in the Faction Benefits table on page \\-\\-\\-.\r\n\r\n#### Proficiency Bonus\r\nFactions have their own proficiency bonus, which scales with their tier. This proficiency bonus affects actions that faction takes as a whole, or actions taken by members of appropriate rank, in the ability scores in which the faction is proficient.\r\n\r\n#### Ability Scores \r\nAbility scores represent what a faction choose to focus on for its enterprises. Their are six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Ability scores are discussed at greater length in Chapter 4: Using Ability Scores.\r\n\r\n### Faction Traits\r\nEvery faction is unique, not just in how they function, but also their goals, beliefs, and what kind of members they attract.\r\n\r\n#### Goals\r\nEach faction has its own goals. One of the most common goals many factions share is the desire for increased wealth and influence. Many factions, however, have goals unique to their own efforts. For instance, a faction might have a goal of maintaining peace and prosperity in their region, directing all of their wealth and influence towards that one goal.\r\n\r\n#### Beliefs\r\nEach faction also has its own beliefs. Many nefarious factions, such as the Exchange, believe power should be wielded by the strong, and that the weak deserve to be enslaved, while a more monetarily motivated faction, such as the Commerce Guild, believe that material wealth is the greatest source of control.\r\n\r\n#### Member Traits\r\nMembers of a faction are often drawn to it because they share common traits with its members. For instance, criminals who prefer to work alone, or in small groups, might be drawn to the Black Sun, while bounty hunters might choose to join the Bounty Broker's Association to earn greater wealth and prestige.\r\n\r\n### Headquarters\r\nMost factions have use of a headquarters. For smaller factions, it might be a simple building, or even a room. For larger factions, however, it might be a space ship, a space station, or even an entire moon or planet. A faction headquarters is required to recruit members to a faction.\r\n\r\nA faction can have any number of headquarters, provided it has the staff and funds to maintain them. However, every headquarters requires at least one 4th rank or higher member to administrate.\r\n\r\n#### Operating Costs\r\nBeyond the required costs for actually maintaining a headquarters, factions have costs directly associated with their functions. These fees might cover licensing fees, bribes, government contracts, etc. These fees amount to roughly 1,000 cr per headquarters per month.\r\n\r\n### Recruiting\r\nIn order for a faction to grow, it must recruit members. While lower tier factions can thrive with only a few members, higher tier factions require constant effort by thousands or more members. Additionally, a smaller faction might have trouble recruiting skilled members, while larger factions probably don't. \r\n\r\nEach membership rank can only support members of a certain CR or higher, as shown in the Membership Ranks CR and Renown table below.\r\n\r\n##### Membership Ranks CR and Renown\r\n|Membership Rank|Minimum Member CR|Monthly Renown Generation|\r\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|1/8|1|\r\n|2|1/2|2|\r\n|3|1|3|\r\n|4|2|4|\r\n|5|5|5|\r\n\r\nAdditionally, certain NPCs might also require a higher tier to join your faction. For instance, a skilled craftsman might not have a high CR, but might still require a faction to be a higher tier to merit joining.\r\n\r\n### Renown\r\nCharacters who act on behalf of their faction's interest earn renown, improving their own standing within their faction as well as their faction's overall effectiveness. In order for a faction to increase in tier, it must have a specific amount of renown, as shown in the Faction Benefits table on page \\-\\-\\-. Additionally, once a faction reaches tier 6, it must have a certain amount of renown generated each month in order to progress to subsequent tiers.\r\n\r\nNPC faction members generate an amount of renown each month determined by their rank in the faction, as shown in the Membership Ranks CR and Renown table above.\r\n\r\n##### Faction Benefits\r\n| Tier | Proficiency Bonus | Features | Required Renown | Monthly Renown Generation|\r\n|:---:|:--:|:---|--:|--:|\r\n| 1st | +2 | Insignia, Faction Training                         |       0 | � |\r\n| 2nd | +2 | Association Proficiency, Faction Activity          |       5 | � |\r\n| 3rd | +2 | Enhanced Insignia                                  |      15 | � |\r\n| 4th | +2 | Ability Score Improvement                          |      30 | � |\r\n| 5th | +3 | Premium Item Stockpile                             |      50 | � |\r\n| 6th | +3 | Faction Training (2)                               |      75 | � |\r\n| 7th | +3 | Association Proficiency (2), Faction Activity (2)  |     100 |     10 |\r\n| 8th | +3 | Ability Score Improvement                          |     150 |     15 |\r\n| 9th | +4 | Prototype Item Stockpile                           |     200 |     20 |\r\n|10th | +4 | Association Expertise                              |     250 |     25 |\r\n|11th | +4 | Faction Training (3), Association Proficiency (3)  |     325 |     30 |\r\n|12th | +4 | Ability Score Improvement                          |     400 |     40 |\r\n|13th | +5 | Advanced Item Stockpile, Faction Activity (3)      |     500 |     50 |\r\n|14th | +5 | Association Expertise (2), Association Advantage   |   1,000 |    100 |\r\n|15th | +5 | Faction Training (4), Association Proficiency (4)  |   2,000 |    200 |\r\n|16th | +5 | Ability Score Improvement                          |   5,000 |    500 |\r\n|17th | +6 | Ability Score Mastery, Legendary                   |  10,000 |  1,000 |\r\n|18th | +6 | Ability Score Mastery                              |  20,000 |  2,000 |\r\n|19th | +6 | Ability Score Mastery                              |  50,000 |  5,000 |\r\n|20th | +6 | Ability Score Mastery, Artifact                    | 100,000 | 10,000 |\r\n\r\n### Insignia\r\nBeginning at 1st tier when you establish your faction, your faction can choose an insignia. Faction members of 1st rank or higher can wear, carry, or otherwise bear your insignia in a fashion appropriate to your faction's operations. Your insignia will be one of the primary ways that members identify themselves as a member of your faction.\r\n\r\n### Faction Training\r\nAlso at 1st tier, your faction gains a favored language or tool. Choose a language, or one of the tool options on page \\_\\_\\_ of the *Player's Handbook*.

The faction ability check is determined by the specific activity, as shown in Chapter 4: Using Ability Scores. Additionally, when they make a d20 roll as a part of the chosen activity, they can use your faction's ability modifier instead of their own modifier, if that number is greater.\r\n\r\nAt 7th and 13th tier, your faction can choose another activity.\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Insignia\r\nStarting at 3rd tier, its insignia gains an enhanced property.

When a 5th rank or higher faction member has spent 1,000 days of downtime furthering the faction's interests, they gain access to this artifact item and can procure it at no cost. \r\n\r\n##### Membership Ranks\r\n| Rank | Features | Required Renown | Other Requirements |\r\n|:---:|:---|:--:|:--:|\r\n| 1st | Earn Renown, Faction Training, Insignia  | 0 | � |\r\n| 2nd | Apprentice, Faction Activity, Premium Item Procurement, Special Missions| 10 | � |\r\n| 3rd | Mentor, Prototype Item Procurement | 25 | 5th level, 1 special mission |\r\n| 4th | Advanced Item Procurement | 50 | 9th level, 3 special missions |\r\n| 5th | Faction Leader  | 100 | 13th level, 10 special missions |\r\n\r\n### Earn Renown\r\nBeginning at 1st rank when you join a faction, you gain the ability to earn renown for your faction, allowing you to advance in rank. For every successful workweek in a downtime activity furthering your faction's interests, you gain 1 renown. Additionally, you gain access to faction-specific missions. Every time you complete a  mission for your faction, you gain 1 or more renown.\r\n\r\n### Faction Training\r\nAlso at 1st rank, you gain access to your faction's favored training.

When your faction reaches 3rd tier, your insignia gains an enhanced property.\r\n\r\n### Apprentice\r\nAt 2nd rank, you gain the ability to be apprenticed to a 3rd rank or higher member of your faction. Bonding with a mentor takes one workweek of downtime spent together furthering your faction's interests in your faction's favored activity. At the end of the workweek, you and your mentor are bonded. You can only have one mentor at a time.

When you roll percentile dice as a part of the chosen activity, you can also make an ability check and add it to the roll. The ability check is determined by the specific activity, as shown in the \\_\\_\\_ table on page \\_\\_\\_. Additionally, when you make a d20 roll as a part of the chosen activity, you can use your faction's association modifier instead of your modifier, if that number is greater.\r\n\r\n### Premium Item Procurement\r\nAdditionally at 2nd rank, after spending at least 50 days of downtime furthering your faction's interests, you gain access to premium enhanced items, which you can purchase at the item's full value, provided your faction is at least 5th tier.

Once you've done so, you can't do so again until you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n# Chapter 4: Using Ability Scores\r\n\r\nix abilities provide a quick description of every faction's collective physical and mental characteristics:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n- **Strength**, measuring the faction membership's physical power\r\n- **Dexterity**, measuring the faction membership's agility\r\n- **Constitution**, measuring the faction membership's endurance\r\n- **Intelligence**, measuring the faction membership's reasoning and memory\r\n- **Wisdom**, measuring the faction membership's awareness and intuition\r\n- **Charisma**, measuring the faction membership's force of personality\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIs a faction comprised of renowned gladiators of great might and fortitude? Or is it a coalition of craftsmen, working together to create the best products available? Force-wielders working together, for good or ill? Or maybe it's a guild of shrewd merchants, attempting to corner the market. Ability scores defined these qualities�a faction's assets as well as weaknesses.\r\n\r\nAbility scores govern a faction's ability to benefit it's members, as well as wage inter-faction conflict. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.\r\n\r\nThis chapter focuses on how to use ability checks, covering how these checks benefit your faction's members and how they interact with other factions.\r\n\r\n## Ability Scores and Modifiers\r\nEach of a faction's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a faction's member's training and competence in activities related to that ability.\r\n\r\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal average, but many factions are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a faction usually reaches. Larger factions can have scores as high as 20, and galaxy-spanning factions can have scores as high as 30.\r\n\r\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.\r\n\r\nTo determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).\r\n\r\nBecause ability modifiers affect almost every ability check, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.\r\n\r\n##### Ability Scores and Modifiers\r\n\r\n|Score|Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|-5|\r\n|2-3|-4|\r\n|4-5|-3|\r\n|6-7|-2|\r\n|8-9|-1|\r\n|10-11|+0|\r\n|12-13|+1|\r\n|14-15|+2|\r\n\r\n|Score|Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|16-17|+3|\r\n|18-19|+4|\r\n|20-21|+5|\r\n|22-23|+6|\r\n|24-25|+7|\r\n|26-27|+8|\r\n|28-29|+9|\r\n|30|+10|\r\n\r\n## Advantage and Disadvantage\r\nSometimes a feature tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\r\n\r\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\r\n\r\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\r\n\r\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of faction features. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.\r\n\r\n## Proficiency Bonus\r\nFactions have a proficiency bonus determined by tier, as detailed in chapter 1. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks.\r\n\r\nYour faction's proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say your faction can add its proficiency bonus to a Wisdom ability check, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, your faction's proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved. for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your faction's proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\r\n\r\nBy the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your faction's proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from its proficiency bonus, you still don't add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if your faction lacks proficiency in the Intelligence ability score, it gains no benefit from a feature that lets it double your proficiency bonus when it make Intelligence  checks.\r\n\r\n### Expertise\r\nCertain features, such as the Association Expertise feature, let your faction double its proficiency bonus with a given ability score, granting expertise in that ability score. As usual, you can only gain expertise in an ability score once.\r\n\r\n## Ability Checks\r\nAn ability check represents a faction's ability to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a faction, or a faction member, attempts an action that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\r\n\r\nFor every ability check, the GM decides which of the 6 abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\r\n\r\nTo make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the faction, or faction member, overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the faction or faction member makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.\r\n\r\n### Contests\r\nSometimes one faction's or faction member's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as accepting a mission reward from a third party. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal�for example, when a faction is trying to usurp control or influence from another faction. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\r\n\r\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That faction or faction member either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\r\n\r\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two faction members tie in a contest to accept a mission reward, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a faction trying to usurp control or influence from another faction, a tie means control or influence is not usurped.\r\n\r\n##### Ability Check DCs\r\n|Task Difficulty|\tDC|\r\n|:--|:--:|\r\n|Very easy|\t5|\r\n|Easy|\t10|\r\n|Medium|\t15|\r\n|Hard\t|20|\r\n|Very hard\t|25|\r\n|Nearly impossible|\t30|\r\n\r\n### Passive Checks\r\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as a faction and its member's normal vigilance, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether a faction succeeds at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a spy.\r\n\r\nHere's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:\r\n\r\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check. If the faction has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.\r\n\r\nFor example. if a 1st-tier faction has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Wisdom, it has a passive Wisdom score of 14.\r\n\r\nThe rules on spying in the \"Espionage\" section below rely on passive checks.\r\n\r\n### Working Together\r\nSometimes two or more factions team up to attempt a task. The faction who's leading the effort, or the one with the highest ability modifier, can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other faction. \r\n\r\nA faction can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, attempting to mass produce a type of blaster requires members with proficiency with armstech's tools, so a faction whose members lack that proficiency can't help another faction in that task. Moreover, a faction can help only when two or more factions working together would actually be productive.\r\n\r\ntrying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover. a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks are no easier with help.\r\n\r\n## Using Each Ability\r\nEvery task that a faction might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\r\n\r\nFactions of 2nd tier and higher are more adept at performing certain downtime activities. When a faction member of 2nd rank or higher attempts the favored downtime activity and rolls percentile dice, they also get to make a faction ability check and add it to the roll, provided they are in an area where the faction has influence. Each downtime activity is tied to a specific ability score, as discussed in this section.\r\n\r\n#### Variant: Activities with Other Abilities\r\nNormally, your faction's favored activity only utilizes a specific ability score. Favoring the Crime downtime activity, for instance, usually applies a faction's Dexterity ability check. During resolution of an activity, however, a faction member might use utilize a different ability score during resolution. In such cases, the GM might allow you to roll a faction ability check utilizing a different ability score, or you might ask if you can use a different faction ability check. For example, if you are performing crime during downtime and using a security kit, your GM might call for a faction Intelligence check when rolling percentile dice, instead of Dexterity, even though Crime is normally associated with Dexterity.\r\n\r\n### Strength\r\nStrength measures the bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which a faction's membership can exert raw physical force.\r\n\r\n#### Strength Activities\r\nMany activities focus on using a character's might and power. When a character performs one of the following downtime activities, and it's their faction's favored downtime activity, they can make a faction ability check:\r\n- Mercenary Contracting\r\n- Pit Fighting\r\n- Work\r\n- Other activities as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Checks\r\nAdditionally, when two factions are in conflict�either directly or indirectly�one faction can attempt the following actions:\r\n- 1 \r\n- 2\r\n- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe faction then makes a Strength check contested by the target faction's Constitution check. On a success, they achieve the attempted action. On a failure, they are instead rebuffed.\r\n\r\n### Dexterity \r\nDexterity measures the agility, reflexes, and balance of a faction's membership.\r\n\r\n#### Dexterity Activities\r\nMany activities capitalize on a character's nimbleness and stealth. When a character performs one of the following downtime activities, and it's their faction's favored downtime activity, they can make a faction ability check:\r\n- Crime\r\n- Work\r\n- Other activities as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Checks\r\nAdditionally, when two factions are in conflict�either directly or indirectly�one faction can attempt the following actions:\r\n- 1 \r\n- 2\r\n- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe faction then makes a Dexterity check contested by the target faction's Intelligence check. On a success, they achieve the attempted action. On a failure, they are instead rebuffed.\r\n\r\n### Constitution\r\nConstitution measures the health, stamina, and vital force of a faction's membership.\r\n\r\n#### Constitution Activities\r\nMany activities focus on using a character's vitality and heartiness. When a character performs one of the following downtime activities, and it's their faction's favored downtime activity, they can make a faction ability check:\r\n\r\n- Work\r\n- Other activities as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Checks\r\nAdditionally, when two factions are in conflict�either directly or indirectly�one faction can attempt the following actions:\r\n- 1 \r\n- 2\r\n- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe faction then makes a Constitution check contested by the target faction's Strength check. On a success, they achieve the attempted action. On a failure, they are instead rebuffed.\r\n\r\n### Intelligence \r\nIntelligence measures the mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability of a faction's membership to reason.\r\n\r\n#### Intelligence Activities\r\nMany activities capitalize on a character's reasoning and memory. When a character performs one of the following downtime activities, and it's their faction's favored downtime activity, they can make a faction ability check:\r\n- Crafting\r\n- Gambling\r\n- Racing\r\n- Research\r\n- Work\r\n- Other activities as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Checks\r\nAdditionally, when two factions are in conflict�either directly or indirectly�one faction can attempt the following actions:\r\n- 1 \r\n- 2\r\n- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe faction then makes an Intelligence check contested by the target faction's Dexterity check. On a success, they achieve the attempted action. On a failure, they are instead rebuffed.\r\n\r\n### Wisdom\r\nWisdom measures how attuned to the world, perceptive, and intuitive a faction's membership is.\r\n\r\n#### Wisdom Activities\r\nMany activities focus on using a character's intuition and awareness. When a character performs one of the following downtime activities, and it's their faction's favored downtime activity, they can make a faction ability check:\r\n- Bounty Hunting\r\n- Work\r\n- Other activities as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Checks\r\nAdditionally, when two factions are in conflict�either directly or indirectly�one faction can attempt the following actions:\r\n- 1 \r\n- 2\r\n- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe faction then makes a Wisdom check contested by the target faction's Charisma check. On a success, they achieve the attempted action. On a failure, they are instead rebuffed.\r\n\r\n### Charisma \r\nCharisma measures the the ability to interact effectively with others, confidence, and eloquence of a faction's membership.\r\n\r\n#### Charisma Activities\r\nMany activities capitalize on a character's charm and presence. When a character performs one of the following downtime activities, and it's their faction's favored downtime activity, they can make a faction ability check:\r\n- Buying Enhanced Items\r\n- Carousing\r\n- Selling Enhanced Items\r\n- Work\r\n- Other activities as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Checks\r\nAdditionally, when two factions are in conflict�either directly or indirectly�one faction can attempt the following actions:\r\n- 1 \r\n- 2\r\n- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe faction then makes a Charisma check contested by the target faction's Wisdom check. On a success, they achieve the attempted action. On a failure, they are instead rebuffed.","contentTypeEnum":0,"contentType":"None","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"3","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Introduction","chapterNumber":1,"contentMarkdown":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nThe *Star Wars* 5th Edition roleplaying game is about vast worlds populated by myriad sites and species. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, SW5e is driven by imagination. It's about picturing the expansive marketplace and seeing the different people's living their lives, and seeing how they might interact with the player's characters.\r\n\r\nThis book is designed to add another significant layer to your SW5e experience. The rules are designed to work alongside the traditional SW5e ruleset, and so an experienced player should have no trouble jumping right into the book. For the less experienced-or more curious-player, this Introduction discusses the basics.\r\n\r\n**Game Master (GM):** As you enter the teeming marketplace in a disreputable sector of Nar Shaddaa, you see merchants of all types peddling wares, trying to entice the flowing traffic. As you move further into the crowd, one of the vendors catches your attention as they hail you.\r\n\r\n**Rickey (playing Vinto):** I'm going to check out what they have for sale.\r\n\r\n**Drew (playing Dash):** I'm going to keep an eye on the crowd to make sure our things aren't stolen.\r\n\r\n**Erik (playing Kodo):** ...\r\n\r\nUnlike a game of make-believe, SW5e gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers' actions. Players roll dice to determine whether or not they can haggle for a better price, or to try to entice a merchant to accept work instead of credits for their goods. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.\r\n\r\n**Game Master (GM):** OK, one at a time. Rickey, you're checking the vendor's goods?\r\n\r\n**Rickey:** Yeah. Do I see anything cool?\r\n\r\n**GM:** Make an Intelligence check.\r\n\r\n**Rickey:** Does my Investigation skill apply?\r\n\r\n**GM:** Sure!\r\n\r\n**Rickey (rolling a d20):** Eight. I hate this die!\r\n\r\n**GM:** You see many trinkets and baubles but nothing catches your eye. And Drew, Dash is watching the crowd?\r\n\r\n**Drew:** Yup!\r\n\r\n**GM:** Okay. Eric, what's Kodo doing?\r\n\r\n**Eric:** ...\r\n\r\nIn the *Star Wars* Dungeons and Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might join a faction, earning renown to increase their standing. They might become benevolent Jedi, malevolent Sith, ruthless bounty hunters, or scurrying scoundrels. If no faction catches their attention, they might instead create their own.\r\n\r\nOne player, however, takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), the game's lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe a populous city, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they spend time buying and selling wares? Or will they look for work and entertainment in the city to make�or spend�their coin?\r\n\r\nThen the GM determines the results of the adventurers' actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, SW5e is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.\r\n\r\nThe game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a **campaign**. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each force defeated, each adventure completed, and each relic recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer's rank in a faction, and the tier of the faction itself.\r\n\r\nThere's no winning and losing in the *Star Wars* Dungeons and Dragons game�at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, dispatched by a Sith lord. The party itself might meet its demise if it antagonizes a powerful and malicious faction. Even so, the other adventurers can beseech a powerful Jedi to revive their fallen comrade, or the players might choose (or be forced) to create new characters to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.\r\n\r\n## Explore Cities\r\nOne of the premier components of *Star Wars* 5th Edition, versus a traditional Dungeons and Dragons campaign, is the massive�almost overwhelming�number of planets. Each planet, and each city, hosts its own species, communities, factions, and traditions.\r\n\r\nEach city hosts its own activities and factions. Players can choose to engage in these activities and join these factions if they so desire. Alternatively, players can instead form their own faction, recruiting other\r\n\r\nmembers to span across multiple cities, planets, or even the galaxy itself.\r\n\r\nBut if your players want to explore cities more indepth, this book is designed to those ends.\r\n\r\n## Using This Book\r\n*Wretched Hives* is divided into eight chapters.\r\n\r\n**Chapters 1-4** are about spending time in cities, joining factions or creating your own, and how to run inter-faction conflict. It includes information on the major activities adventurers can engage in, as well as the boons they gain for joining a faction and maintaining a good standing. It also includes the rules for creating their own faction, if they so choose, with a step-by-step guide on how to build one. Lastly, it includes rules to help govern or inspire conflict between factions.\r\n\r\n**Chapters 5-6** include new adventuring gear and customization options to help players realize their characters. It adds many new weapons and armor, including new properties, as well as all sorts of new adventuring gear, tools, and trade goods.\r\n\r\n**Chapters 7-8** include the rules for enhanced items and tools, including how to implement them in your game and give tools more weight.\r\n\r\n### Tiers of Proficiency \r\nIn addition to the two tiers of proficiency present in the Player's Handbook�proficiency and expertise�Wretched Hives introduces four new tiers of proficiency: trained, mastery, high mastery, and grand mastery. Additionally, the six tiers of proficiency now form an established hierarchy, from trained to grand mastery. Progressing from one tier to the next is not a given, however; if you're proficient in a skill, and you gain that proficiency again from another source, you do not automatically gain expertise. Instead, in these instances, you can choose another proficiency of the same type, as discussed in Chapter 4 of the Player's Handbook.\r\n\r\n#### Trained\r\nTrained lets you add half your proficiency bonus. Certain features, such as the Led by the Force class feature, grant this tier of proficiency. A character can be trained in skills, tools, saving throws, and weapons.\r\n\r\n> When a character becomes proficient in a skill or tool, they can instead choose to become trained in two skills or two tools, respectively. If a feature or feat would grant expertise in a skill or tool in which you are proficient, you would instead become proficient in the two skills or tools in which you became trained.\r\n\r\n#### Proficient\r\nProficient lets you add your proficiency bonus. Proficiency can be obtained in skills, tools, saving throws, and weapons.\r\n\r\n#### Expertise\r\nExpertise lets you add twice your proficiency bonus. Expertise can be obtained in skills, tools, and saving throws.\r\n\r\n#### Mastery\r\nMastery lets you add twice your proficiency bonus. Additionally, you always have advantage with mastery. Mastery can be obtained in skills, tools, and saving throws.\r\n\r\n#### High Mastery\r\nHigh mastery lets you add twice your proficiency bonus. Additionally, you always have advantage with high mastery, and when you make a roll with advantage at this tier of proficiency, you can reroll one of the dice once. You must use the new roll. High mastery can be obtained in skills, tools, and saving throws.\r\n\r\n#### Grand Mastery\r\nGrand mastery lets you add twice your proficiency bonus. Additionally, you always have advantage with grand mastery, and when you make a roll with advantage at this tier of proficiency, you can reroll each of the dice once. You must use the new roll for each die. Grand mastery can be obtained in skills, tools, and saving throws.\r\n\r\n### Critical Saving Throws\r\nThis book introduces a new mechanic that enables saving throws to crit, both in a creature critically failing or succeeding on the saving throw. Natively, creatures cannot critically fail or succeed on saving throws; instead, certain features or items enable this capacity.\r\n\r\n#### Critical Failures\r\nWhen a creature critically fails a saving throw against an effect that would deal damage, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.\r\n\r\n***Critical Fail Range.*** The critical fail range of an effect determines on what d20 results a creature critically fails a save. Typically, effects have a critical fail range of 0, meaning a creature can't critically fail a saving throw. A critical fail range of 1 would mean a creature critically fails on a saving throw if they roll a 1, while a critical fail range of 2 means a creature critically fails a saving throw if they roll a 1 or a 2. A critical fail range cannot exceed 4, causing creatures to critically fail on a 1-4.\r\n\r\nCertain effects, such as Explosives Style, cause creatures to take maximum damage if they roll a 1 on the saving throw. Such effects should be treated as a critical fail range of 1.\r\n\r\n> #### Keen Critical Saves\r\n> Weapons with alternate fire modes, such as burst or bright, don't benefit from the keen property. Consider extending the benefits of the keen property to the critical fail range for those weapons.\r\n\r\n#### Critical Successes\r\nWhen a creature critically succeeds on a saving throw against an effect that would deal damage, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the minimum.\r\n\r\n***Critical Success Range.*** A creature's critical success range determines on what d20 results that creature critically succeeds on a save. Typically, a creature has a critical success range of 0, meaning a creature can't critically succeed on a saving throw. A critical success range of 1 would mean a creature critically succeeds on a saving throw if they roll a 20, while a critical success range of 2 means a creature critically succeeds on a saving throw if they roll a 19 or a 20. A critical success range cannot exceed 4, causing a creature to critically succeed on a 17-20.\r\n\r\n> #### Variant: Rolling 1 or 20\r\n> In addition to critical failures and successes, you can consider adding the following rule as well.\r\n> If the d20 roll for a saving throw is a 20, a creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw, even if the result of their save would not meet or exceed the save DC, and they treat the save as a critical success.\r\n> If the d20 roll for a saving throw is a 1, a creature automatically fails the saving throw, even if the result of their save would meet or exceed the save DC, and they treat the save as a critical failure.\r\n\r\n### Crafting and Blueprints\r\nIf crafting is intended to be integral to your game, your player's characters should start with�and learn over time�the blueprints to craft enhanced items over time. All characters with proficiency in a tool know how to craft all unenhanced items that are governed by that tool. Additionally, a character with proficiency in a tool knows a number of blueprints equal to half their level (rounded up). A character with expertise instead knows a number of blueprints equal to their level. Whenever a character gains a level, they can exchange one blueprint they know for another one. A character can only know standard blueprints at 1st level, but can learn higher rarity blueprints as they gain increase in levels. A character can learn premium blueprints starting at 5th level, prototype at 9th level, advanced at 13th level, legendary at 17th level, and artifact at 20th level. As GM, you can allow player's to choose their own blueprints, or you can choose for them. If a character has proficiency in multiple tools, they determine their known blueprints for each tool separately.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a 3rd-level character with proficiency in armstech's implements knows how to create all unenhanced blasters and vibroweapons, as well as up to two enhanced blasters or vibroweapons of standard rarity. A 5th-level character with expertise, however, can know up to five enhanced blasters or vibroweapons of premium rarity or lower.\r\n\r\n### Careful Checks\r\nWhen you spend at least 10 minutes performing an activity that requires an ability check, that check has consequences for failure, and you don't have disadvantage on the check, you can choose to make that check carefully, colloquially called \"taking 10\". If you do so, you treat the check as if you had rolled a 10 on the d20. For instance, if you are crafting an item, during resolution you make an Intelligence check with the appropriate tools to determine your d100 Roll Modifier. Instead of rolling the d20, you can make a careful check and take 10, treating the check as if you'd rolled a 10, adding your Intelligence modifier and proficiency bonus, if you are proficient with the tools.\r\n\r\nIf you would have advantage on the check, you can instead take 15. \r\n\r\n### Engineers\r\nMany engineer archetypes are built around modifying a specific item. For instance, armstech engineer is focused entirely on modifying and upgrading blasters and vibroweapons. If you have any of these engineers at the table, while using this book, you'll want to include the following rules:\r\n- Engineer's class-specific chassis are not restricted to using mods of a certain rarity. For instance, if a 4th-level armstech engineer comes across an artifact rarity blaster modification, and they are skilled enough to install it, they can benefit from it.\r\n- Engineer's class-specific chassis are not restricted to only one of each modification, but if that modification adds a bonus, such as +1 to attack rolls, or the keen 1 property, the total of that bonus across the item can not exceed half the engineer's proficiency bonus (rounded up). \r\n- Engineer's class-specific chassis can include a number of augments up to half their proficiency bonus (rounded up), which count towards their total modifications. For instance, a 4th-level engineer, with a proficiency bonus of +2, can have only one augment in their item.\r\n- Engineer's class-specific chassis only ever count as one attunement, regardless of the rarity of the modifications inside it.\r\n\r\n## What It Brings\r\n*Wretched Hives* is designed to be an *in addition to* rather than *instead of*. If you implement some�or all�of these rules, however, you create more powerful adventuring parties. The rules included here add an additional level of customization to characters. All of the rules work in conjunction with each other, but are generally not interdependent; use as much or as little as you like.","contentTypeEnum":0,"contentType":"None","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"1","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Step-By-Step Factions","chapterNumber":1,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 1: Step-By-Step Factions\r\n\r\nMany factions span the galaxy, from lowly gangs inhabiting a single city to governments controlling the majority of known planets. While many characters will find a faction they want to join�for instance, a Jedi will most likely want to climb the ranks of the Jedi Order�many characters will prefer to build their own.\r\n\r\nBefore you dive into step 1 below, thinking about whether or not establishing your own faction is the correct route, and what your faction will do that is not already done better by others. You might want to create your own bounty hunter organization and try to take on the greatest bounties the galaxy has to offer. Maybe you want to start your own government and break away from the known powers. Perhaps you want to start your own faction of Force-wielders, separate from the Jedi and the Sith. Or maybe you just want to create your own chain of casino resorts, with pazaak and companions.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a faction in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the faction you want. Your conception of your faction might evolve with each choice you make. What's important is that your faction helps you realize a character you're excited to play.\r\n\r\nThroughout this section, we use the term **faction sheet** to mean whatever you use to track your faction, whether it's a formal sheet (like the ones at the end of these rules), some sort of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. The official SW5e sheets are a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.\r\n\r\n> ##### Building the Mandalorians\r\n> Each step of faction creation includes an example of that step, with a player building the iconic faction the Mandalorians.\r\n\r\n### 1. Determine your Ideals\r\nEvery faction deviates in what they value, how they exercise those values, and what kind of members they attract. Your faction's ideals help determine what kind of members you'll attract, should you decide to recruit outside the confines of your party.\r\n\r\n#### Goals\r\nEach faction has its own goals. One of the most common goals many factions share is the desire for increased wealth and influence. Many factions, however, have goals unique to their own efforts. For instance, a faction might have a goal of maintaining peace and prosperity in their region, directing all of their wealth and influence towards that one goal.\r\n\r\n#### Beliefs\r\nEach faction also has its own beliefs. Many nefarious factions, such as the Exchange, believe power should be wielded by the strong, and that the weak deserve to be enslaved, while a more monetarily motivated faction, such as the Commerce Guild, believe that material wealth is the greatest source of control.\r\n\r\n#### Member Traits\r\nMembers of a faction are often drawn to it because they share common traits with its members. For instance, criminals who prefer to work alone, or in small groups, might be drawn to the Black Sun, while bounty hunters might choose to join the Bounty Broker's Association to earn greater wealth and prestige.\r\n\r\n#### Insignia\r\nEvery faction has a symbol that represents it, whether that symbol is worn publicly or only shown in secret.\r\n\r\n> ##### Building the Mandalorians, Step 1\r\n> Mandalorian culture places heavy emphasis on strength and worthiness. The primary **goal** of the Mandalorians is to prove that their strength is greater than that of others. Mandalorian **beliefs** are characterized by the *Resol'nare*, or the Six Actions:\r\n> - A Mandalorian must wear armor. \r\n> - A Mandalorian must speak Mando'a. \r\n> - A Mandalorian must defend themself and their family. \r\n> - A Mandalorian must contribute to the overall well-being of the clan. \r\n> - A Mandalorian must raise their children as Mandalorians. \r\n> - A Mandalorian must heed Mandalore's call and rally to their cause.\r\n> Mandalorians often share **member traits** of being strong, hardy, resilient, and uncompromising. The Mandalorian **insignia**�the *Kyr'bes*�features the skull of a mythosaur. It is a badge of honor that Mandalorians wear openly.\r\n\r\n### 2. Establish a Headquarters\r\nMost factions have use of a headquarters. For smaller factions, it might be a simple building, or even a room. For larger factions, however, it might be a space ship, a space station, or even an entire moon or planet. A faction headquarters is required to recruit members to a faction.\r\n\r\nWhat type of headquarters you choose for your faction makes a statement about how effective your faction is in whatever field it operates. Choosing the appropriate location and appearance for your faction's headquarters can help or hinder your ability to recruit new members.\r\n\r\n#### Operating Costs\r\nBeyond the required costs for actually maintaining a headquarters, factions have costs directly associated with their functions. These fees might cover licensing fees, bribes, government contracts, etc. These fees amount to roughly 1,000 cr per headquarters per month.\r\n\r\n> ##### Building the Mandalorians, Step 2\r\n> The Mandalorians have myriad headquarters throughout the galaxy, including a massive flagship the *Spirit of Vengeance.*\r\n\r\n### 3. Determine Ability Scores\r\nMuch of what your faction does�and how it directly affects its members�depend on its six abilities: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma**. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your faction sheet. The six abilities and their use in the game are described in the **Using Ability Scores** chapter. \r\n\r\nYou generate your faction's six **ability scores** using a standard array: 16, 14, 14, 12, 10, 8. You then take these six numbers and write each number beside one of your faction's abilities to assign score to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. \r\n\r\nAfter assigning your ability scores, determine your faction's **ability modifiers** using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.\r\n\r\n> ##### Building the Mandalorians, Step 3\r\n> Mandalorians value strength above all, so we assign the highest score, 16, in Strength. The next highest scores�both 14�we apply to Constitution and Wisdom, since Mandalorians are both resilient and perceptive. We then apply the final three scores�12, 10, and 8�to Charisma, Dexterity, and Intelligence, respectively. The Mandalorian ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 16 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 14 (+2), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 14 (+2), Charisma 12 (+1).\r\n\r\n##### Ability Scores and Modifiers\r\n|Score|Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|-5|\r\n|2-3|-4|\r\n|4-5|-3|\r\n|6-7|-2|\r\n|8-9|-1|\r\n|10-11|+0|\r\n|12-13|+1|\r\n|14-15|+2|\r\n|16-17|+3|\r\n|18-19|+4|\r\n|20-21|+5|\r\n|22-23|+6|\r\n|24-25|+7|\r\n|26-27|+8|\r\n|28-29|+9|\r\n|30|+10|\r\n\r\n### 4. Recruitment\r\nIn order for a faction to grow, it must recruit members. A smaller faction will have trouble recruiting skilled members, while larger factions don't. \r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\nFactors, such as a faction's ideals, headquarters, and ability scores play a huge part into how many people a faction can recruit, and how skilled those individuals are. Additionally, many higher skilled potential members of a faction will not consider joining until the faction reaches a high enough tier.\r\n\r\n#### Dues\r\nEvery faction comes with some requirements that must be fulfilled for members to maintain their status in the faction. For some, it might be simple credit dues. For others, they might require a certain amount of work each month. Consider what your faction's dues should be carefully.\r\n\r\n#### Membership Ranks\r\nFactions have five total ranks. New members start at 1st rank, and over time can work their way as high as 5th rank. Each rank unlocks unique benefits on its own, in addition to the normal benefits of faction membership. \r\n\r\n> ##### Building the Mandalorians, Step 4\r\n> Mandalorians are a large, galaxy-spanning faction, that doesn't rely on active recruitment. Instead, new members tend to seek out Mandalorian clans to join. Mandalorians require new members to proficient in at least one martial weapon and require at least one workweek of work a month to retain status.\r\n\r\n### 5. Come Together\r\nFactions are a great way to tie a party together in a way that an adventure sometimes can't. To some parties, the founding and expanding of a faction can be an adventure in itself.\r\n\r\n#### Beyond 1st Tier\r\nAs your faction expands and earns renown, it increases in tier. Each tier unlocks new features, or expands on old ones.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Features\r\nWhen your faction increases in tier, it offers features that benefit members, as shown in the **Factions and Membership** chapter. Some of these features allow you to increase your faction's ability scores. You can't increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every faction's proficiency bonus increases at certain tiers.\r\n\r\nSome features only apply to members who have achieved a certain rank. For instance, a 5th-tier faction has access to a cache of premium enhanced items, but only members of 2nd rank or higher are able to requisition from that cache.\r\n\r\n#### Renown \r\nRenown is the primary source of faction and membership progression. Characters earn renown when they work on behalf of their faction, benefiting both themselves and the faction itself. \r\n\r\n> ##### Building the Mandalorians, Step 5\r\n> Mandalorians are a tier 17 faction, having existed for thousands of years, unlocking numerous features over time.\r\n> ***Faction Training.*** Mandalorians have four faction training options. They have their faction-specific language, *Mando'a*. They also place heavy emphasis on crafting, so they have armormech's tools, armstech's tools, and mechanic's kits.\r\n> ***Assocation Proficiency.*** Mandalorians are proficient in four ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom. When the faction makes an ability check with these abilities, they add their proficiency bonus (+6) to the check.\r\n> ***Faction Activity.*** Mandalorians have three faction activities: Bounty Hunting, Mercenary Contracting, and Pit Fighting.\r\n> ***Enhanced Insignia.*** Mandalorians have an enhanced insignia. While wearing their insignia, all Mandalorians can cast the *combustive shot* at-will tech power (Player's Handbook, page 230). Intelligence is their casting ability for this tech power.\r\n> ***Ability Score Improvement.*** Mandalorians have four ability scores improvements. They apply two of them to Strength, one to Dexterity, and one to Constitution. The Mandalorian ability scores and modifiers now look like this: Strength 20 (+5), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 14 (+2), Charisma 12 (+1).\r\n> ***Premium Item Stockpile.*** Mandalorians choose Mandalorian Helmet as their favored premium enhanced item. Any 2nd rank or higher members can procure this item.\r\n> ***Prototype Item Stockpile.*** Mandalorians choose Mandalorian Beskar'gam as their favored prototype enhanced item. Any 3rd rank or higher members can procure this item.\r\n> ***Association Expertise.*** Mandalorians have expertise in two ability scores: Strength and Wisdom. When the faction makes an ability check with these abilities, they add twice their proficiency bonus (+12), instead of their normal proficiency bonus.\r\n> ***Advanced Item Stockpile.*** Mandalorians choose Mandalorian Shuk'orok as their favored advanced enhanced item. Any 4th rank or higher members can procure this item.\r\n> ***Association Advantage.*** Mandalorians have advantage on one ability score: Strength. When the faction makes an ability check with this ability, they have advantage on the roll.\r\n> ***Ability Score Mastery.*** Mandalorians have one ability score mastery. They apply this to Strength, increasing the score and it's maximum by 2. The Mandalorian ability scores and modifiers now look like this: Strength 22 (+6), Dexterity 12 (+1), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 14 (+2), Charisma 12 (+1).\r\n> ***Legendary.*** Mandalorians choose the Darksaber as their favored legendary enhanced item. Only one 5th rank member can procure this item.","contentTypeEnum":0,"contentType":"None","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"1","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Tool Proficiencies","chapterNumber":8,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 8: Tool Proficiencies\r\n\r\nTool proficiencies are a useful way to highlight a character's background and talents. At the game table, though, the use of tools sometimes overlaps with the use of skills, and it can be unclear how to use them together in certain situations. This section offers various ways that tools can be used in the game.\r\n\r\nTo make tool proficiencies more attractive choices for the characters, you can use the methods outlined below.\r\n\r\n## Tool Descriptions\r\nThe following sections go into detail about the tools presented in Chapter 5, as well as those present in the *Player's Handbook*, offering advice on how to use them in a campaign.\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph in each description gives details on what a set of tools is made up of. A character who is proficient with a tool knows how to use all of its component parts.\r\n\r\n#### Skills \r\nEvery tool potentially provides bonuses on a check when used in conjunction with certain skills, provided a character is proficient with both the tool and the skill. Each tool grants bonuses to three skills.\r\n\r\nWith respect to skills, the system is mildly abstract in terms of what a tool proficiency represents; essentially, it assumes that a character who has proficiency with a tool also has learned about facets of the trade or profession that are not necessarily associated with the use of the tool.\r\n\r\n***Advantage.*** If the use of a tool and the use of a skill both apply to a check, and a character is proficient with the tool and the skill, consider allowing the character to make the check with advantage. This simple benefit can go a long way toward encouraging players to pick up tool proficiencies. In the tool descriptions that follow, this benefit is often expressed as additional insight (or something similar), which translates into an increased chance that the check will be a success.\r\n\r\n***Added Benefit.*** Additionally, consider giving characters who have both a relevant skill and a relevant tool proficiency an added benefit on a successful check. This benefit might be in the form of more detailed information or could simulate the effect of a different sort of successful check. For instance, a character proficient with constructor's implements makes a successful Wisdom (Perception) check to find a secret door in a wall. Not only does the character notice the door's presence, but you decide that the tool proficiency entitles the character to an automatic success on an Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine how to open the door.\r\n\r\n#### Other Tools\r\nAdditionally, at the GM's discretion, certain tools might grant bonuses when used in conjunction with another tool, provided a character is proficient with both. For instance, if a character is proficient with both munitions kits and armstech's implements, you might grant them advantage on checks they make with either tool.\r\n\r\n### Special Use\r\nProficiency with a tool usually brings with it a particular benefit in the form of a special use, as described in this paragraph. During a short or long rest, you can only activate the special use of one of your tools.\r\n\r\n#### Sample DCs\r\nA table at the end of each section lists activities that a tool can be used to perform, and suggested DCs for the necessary ability checks.\r\n\r\n##### Item Specific Tools\r\n|Tool|Uses|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|Archaeologist kit|�|\r\n|Armormech's implements|Armor, shields|\r\n|Armstech's implements|Blasters, vibroweapons|\r\n|Artificer's implements|Focus generators, holocrons, lightweapons|\r\n|Artillerist's kit|Turrets|\r\n|Artist's implements|Artwork, sculptures|\r\n|Astrotech's implements|Droid customizations, droids|\r\n|Audiotech's implements|\r\n|Bioanalysis kit|Antitoxins|\r\n|Biochemist's kit|Adrenals, medpacs, stimpacs|\r\n|Biotech's implements|Cybernetic augmentations|\r\n|Brewer's kit|Alcohol|\r\n|Chef's kit|Food|\r\n|Constructor's implements|Buildings and structures|\r\n|Cybertech's implements|Datacrons, wristpads|\r\n|Demolitions kit|Explosives|\r\n|Disguise kit|Disguises|\r\n|Forgery kit|Falsified documents|\r\n|Gadgeteer's implements|Barriers, gadgets, jetpacks|\r\n|Gaming set|�|\r\n|Geneticist's implements|Genetic mutations|\r\n|Jeweler's implements|Jewelry|\r\n|Mechanic's kit|Starships, vehicles|\r\n|Munitions kit|Ammunition|\r\n|Musical instrument|�|\r\n|Poisoner's kit|Poisons|\r\n|Scavenging kit|�|\r\n|Security kit|Containers, locks|\r\n|Slicer's kit|Computers, software|\r\n|Spicer's kit|Substances|\r\n|Surveyor's implements|Maps|\r\n|Synthweaver's implements|Clothing, footwear|\r\n|Tinker's implements|Augments, trinkets|\r\n\r\n##### Tools by Item\r\n\r\n|Item|Tool|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|||\r\n|Adrenals|Biochemist's kit|\r\n|Ammunition|Munitions kit|\r\n|Armor|Armormech's tools|\r\n|Artisan's implements|Tinker's implements|\r\n|Augments|Tinker's implements|\r\n|Barding|Armormech's kit|\r\n|Barriers|Gadgeteer's implements|\r\n|Belts|Gadgeteer's implements Synthweaver's implements|\r\n|Blasters|Armstech's implements|\r\n|Blueprints|Determined by the tool that creates the result of the blueprint|\r\n|Boots|Armormech's implements|\r\n|Buildings|Constructor's kit|\r\n|Capes|Synthweaver's implements|\r\n|Catalyzers|Cybertech's implements|\r\n|Circlets|Jeweler's implements|\r\n|Cloaks|Synthweaver's implements|\r\n|Clothes|Synthweaver's implements|\r\n|Computer spikes|Slicer's kit|\r\n|Cowls|Synthweaver's implements|\r\n|Cybernetic augmentations|Biotech's implements|\r\n|Datacrons|Cybertech's implements|\r\n|Droid customizations|Astrotech's implements|\r\n|Droids|Astrotech's implements|\r\n|Explosives|Demolitions kit|\r\n|Focus generators|Artificer's implements|\r\n|Footwear|Synthweaver's implements|\r\n|Gaming sets|Tinker's implements|\r\n|Gauntlets|Armormech's tools|\r\n|Goggles|Gadgeteer's implements|\r\n|Helmets|Armormech's implements|\r\n\r\n|Item|Tool|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|||\r\n|Holocrons|Artificer's implements|\r\n|Jetpack|Gadgeteer's implements|\r\n|Lightweapons|Artificer's implements|\r\n|Mantles|Synthweaver's implements|\r\n|Medpacs|Biochemist's kit|\r\n|Modifications|Determined by the chassis's governing tool|\r\n|Musical instruments|Audiotech's implements|\r\n|Necklaces|Jeweler's implements|\r\n|Pants|Synthweaver's implements|\r\n|Pauldrons|Armormech's implements|\r\n|Poisons|Poisoner's kit|\r\n|Repair kit|Astrotech's implements|\r\n|Rings|Jeweler's implements|\r\n|Robes|Synthweaver's implements|\r\n|Rocket boots|Gadgeteer's implements|\r\n|Rocketpack|Gadgeteer's implements|\r\n|Security spike|Security kit|\r\n|Shields|Armormech's implements|\r\n|Specialist kits|Tinker's implements|\r\n|Starships|Mechanic's kit|\r\n|Stimpacs|Biochemist's kit|\r\n|Substances|Brewer's kit Spicer's kit|\r\n|Teleporters|Tinker's implements|\r\n|Tunics|Synthweaver's implements|\r\n|Turrets|Artillerist's kit|\r\n|Vambraces|Armormech's implements|\r\n|Vehicles|Mechanic's kit|\r\n|Vibroweapons|Armstech's implements|\r\n|Wristpads|Cybertech's implements|\r\n\r\n## Alchemist's kit\r\n*Tool description.*\r\n\r\n#### Skill 1\r\n*Skill and tool description interaction.*\r\n\r\n#### Skill 2\r\n*Skill and tool description interaction.*\r\n\r\n#### Skill 3\r\n*Skill and tool description interaction.*\r\n\r\n### Feature\r\n*Feature that utilizes the tool in some capacity.*\r\n\r\n##### Sample Activities\r\n|Activity|DC|\r\n|:--|:--:|\r\n|*Activity description*|xx|\r\n\r\n## Archaeologist Kit\r\nThis kit contains instruments used to carefully collect crystals, gems, relics, and other heirlooms.

Or is it a coalition of craftsmen, working together to create the best products available? Force-wielders working together, for good or ill? Or maybe it's a guild of shrewd merchants, attempting to corner the market. Ability scores defined these qualities�a faction's assets as well as weaknesses.\r\n\r\nAbility scores govern a faction's ability to benefit it's members, as well as wage inter-faction conflict. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.\r\n\r\nThis chapter focuses on how to use ability checks, covering how these checks benefit your faction's members and how they interact with other factions.\r\n\r\n## Ability Scores and Modifiers\r\nEach of a faction's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a faction's member's training and competence in activities related to that ability.\r\n\r\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal average, but many factions are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a faction usually reaches. Larger factions can have scores as high as 20, and galaxy-spanning factions can have scores as high as 30.\r\n\r\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.\r\n\r\nTo determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).\r\n\r\nBecause ability modifiers affect almost every ability check, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.\r\n\r\n##### Ability Scores and Modifiers\r\n\r\n|Score|Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|-5|\r\n|2-3|-4|\r\n|4-5|-3|\r\n|6-7|-2|\r\n|8-9|-1|\r\n|10-11|+0|\r\n|12-13|+1|\r\n|14-15|+2|\r\n\r\n|Score|Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|16-17|+3|\r\n|18-19|+4|\r\n|20-21|+5|\r\n|22-23|+6|\r\n|24-25|+7|\r\n|26-27|+8|\r\n|28-29|+9|\r\n|30|+10|\r\n\r\n## Advantage and Disadvantage\r\nSometimes a feature tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\r\n\r\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\r\n\r\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\r\n\r\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of faction features. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.\r\n\r\n## Proficiency Bonus\r\nFactions have a proficiency bonus determined by tier, as detailed in chapter 1. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks.\r\n\r\nYour faction's proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say your faction can add its proficiency bonus to a Wisdom ability check, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, your faction's proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved. for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your faction's proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\r\n\r\nBy the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your faction's proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from its proficiency bonus, you still don't add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if your faction lacks proficiency in the Intelligence ability score, it gains no benefit from a feature that lets it double your proficiency bonus when it make Intelligence  checks.\r\n\r\n### Expertise\r\nCertain features, such as the Association Expertise feature, let your faction double its proficiency bonus with a given ability score, granting expertise in that ability score. As usual, you can only gain expertise in an ability score once.\r\n\r\n## Ability Checks\r\nAn ability check represents a faction's ability to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a faction, or a faction member, attempts an action that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\r\n\r\nFor every ability check, the GM decides which of the 6 abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\r\n\r\nTo make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the faction, or faction member, overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the faction or faction member makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.\r\n\r\n### Contests\r\nSometimes one faction's or faction member's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as accepting a mission reward from a third party. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal�for example, when a faction is trying to usurp control or influence from another faction. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\r\n\r\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That faction or faction member either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\r\n\r\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two faction members tie in a contest to accept a mission reward, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a faction trying to usurp control or influence from another faction, a tie means control or influence is not usurped.\r\n\r\n##### Ability Check DCs\r\n|Task Difficulty|\tDC|\r\n|:--|:--:|\r\n|Very easy|\t5|\r\n|Easy|\t10|\r\n|Medium|\t15|\r\n|Hard\t|20|\r\n|Very hard\t|25|\r\n|Nearly impossible|\t30|\r\n\r\n### Passive Checks\r\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as a faction and its member's normal vigilance, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether a faction succeeds at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a spy.\r\n\r\nHere's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:\r\n\r\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check. If the faction has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.\r\n\r\nFor example. if a 1st-tier faction has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Wisdom, it has a passive Wisdom score of 14.\r\n\r\nThe rules on spying in the \"Espionage\" section below rely on passive checks.\r\n\r\n### Working Together\r\nSometimes two or more factions team up to attempt a task. The faction who's leading the effort, or the one with the highest ability modifier, can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other faction. \r\n\r\nA faction can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, attempting to mass produce a type of blaster requires members with proficiency with armstech's tools, so a faction whose members lack that proficiency can't help another faction in that task. Moreover, a faction can help only when two or more factions working together would actually be productive.\r\n\r\ntrying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover. a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks are no easier with help.\r\n\r\n## Using Each Ability\r\nEvery task that a faction might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\r\n\r\nFactions of 2nd tier and higher are more adept at performing certain downtime activities. When a faction member of 2nd rank or higher attempts the favored downtime activity and rolls percentile dice, they also get to make a faction ability check and add it to the roll, provided they are in an area where the faction has influence. Each downtime activity is tied to a specific ability score, as discussed in this section.\r\n\r\n#### Variant: Activities with Other Abilities\r\nNormally, your faction's favored activity only utilizes a specific ability score. Favoring the Crime downtime activity, for instance, usually applies a faction's Dexterity ability check. During resolution of an activity, however, a faction member might use utilize a different ability score during resolution. In such cases, the GM might allow you to roll a faction ability check utilizing a different ability score, or you might ask if you can use a different faction ability check. For example, if you are performing crime during downtime and using a security kit, your GM might call for a faction Intelligence check when rolling percentile dice, instead of Dexterity, even though Crime is normally associated with Dexterity.\r\n\r\n### Strength\r\nStrength measures the bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which a faction's membership can exert raw physical force.\r\n\r\n#### Strength Activities\r\nMany activities focus on using a character's might and power. When a character performs one of the following downtime activities, and it's their faction's favored downtime activity, they can make a faction ability check:\r\n- Mercenary Contracting\r\n- Pit Fighting\r\n- Work\r\n- Other activities as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Checks\r\nAdditionally, when two factions are in conflict�either directly or indirectly�one faction can attempt the following actions:\r\n- 1 \r\n- 2\r\n- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe faction then makes a Strength check contested by the target faction's Constitution check. On a success, they achieve the attempted action. On a failure, they are instead rebuffed.\r\n\r\n### Dexterity \r\nDexterity measures the agility, reflexes, and balance of a faction's membership.\r\n\r\n#### Dexterity Activities\r\nMany activities capitalize on a character's nimbleness and stealth. When a character performs one of the following downtime activities, and it's their faction's favored downtime activity, they can make a faction ability check:\r\n- Crime\r\n- Work\r\n- Other activities as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Checks\r\nAdditionally, when two factions are in conflict�either directly or indirectly�one faction can attempt the following actions:\r\n- 1 \r\n- 2\r\n- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe faction then makes a Dexterity check contested by the target faction's Intelligence check. On a success, they achieve the attempted action. On a failure, they are instead rebuffed.\r\n\r\n### Constitution\r\nConstitution measures the health, stamina, and vital force of a faction's membership.\r\n\r\n#### Constitution Activities\r\nMany activities focus on using a character's vitality and heartiness. When a character performs one of the following downtime activities, and it's their faction's favored downtime activity, they can make a faction ability check:\r\n\r\n- Work\r\n- Other activities as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Checks\r\nAdditionally, when two factions are in conflict�either directly or indirectly�one faction can attempt the following actions:\r\n- 1 \r\n- 2\r\n- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe faction then makes a Constitution check contested by the target faction's Strength check. On a success, they achieve the attempted action. On a failure, they are instead rebuffed.\r\n\r\n### Intelligence \r\nIntelligence measures the mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability of a faction's membership to reason.\r\n\r\n#### Intelligence Activities\r\nMany activities capitalize on a character's reasoning and memory. When a character performs one of the following downtime activities, and it's their faction's favored downtime activity, they can make a faction ability check:\r\n- Crafting\r\n- Gambling\r\n- Racing\r\n- Research\r\n- Work\r\n- Other activities as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Checks\r\nAdditionally, when two factions are in conflict�either directly or indirectly�one faction can attempt the following actions:\r\n- 1 \r\n- 2\r\n- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe faction then makes an Intelligence check contested by the target faction's Dexterity check. On a success, they achieve the attempted action. On a failure, they are instead rebuffed.\r\n\r\n### Wisdom\r\nWisdom measures how attuned to the world, perceptive, and intuitive a faction's membership is.\r\n\r\n#### Wisdom Activities\r\nMany activities focus on using a character's intuition and awareness. When a character performs one of the following downtime activities, and it's their faction's favored downtime activity, they can make a faction ability check:\r\n- Bounty Hunting\r\n- Work\r\n- Other activities as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Checks\r\nAdditionally, when two factions are in conflict�either directly or indirectly�one faction can attempt the following actions:\r\n- 1 \r\n- 2\r\n- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe faction then makes a Wisdom check contested by the target faction's Charisma check. On a success, they achieve the attempted action. On a failure, they are instead rebuffed.\r\n\r\n### Charisma \r\nCharisma measures the the ability to interact effectively with others, confidence, and eloquence of a faction's membership.\r\n\r\n#### Charisma Activities\r\nMany activities capitalize on a character's charm and presence. When a character performs one of the following downtime activities, and it's their faction's favored downtime activity, they can make a faction ability check:\r\n- Buying Enhanced Items\r\n- Carousing\r\n- Selling Enhanced Items\r\n- Work\r\n- Other activities as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\n#### Faction Checks\r\nAdditionally, when two factions are in conflict�either directly or indirectly�one faction can attempt the following actions:\r\n- 1 \r\n- 2\r\n- Other actions as deemed appropriate by the GM.\r\n\r\nThe faction then makes a Charisma check contested by the target faction's Wisdom check. On a success, they achieve the attempted action. On a failure, they are instead rebuffed.","contentTypeEnum":0,"contentType":"None","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"4","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null}]
