You can't increase your ability scores other than Constitution above 20, or your Constitution above 26, with this feature.\r\n\r\n#### Additional Hull and Shield Dice\r\nYour ship gains 2 additional Hull Dice and 2 additional Shield Dice. It gains 2 additional Hull Dice and 2 additional Shield Dice at 2nd tier (4, each), 3rd tier (6, each), 4th tier (8, each), and 5th tier (10, each).\r\n\r\n#### Armor Class Improvement\r\nBeginning at second Tier, your ship's armor class improves, giving your ship a +1 to its AC.  It gains an additional +1 bonus to AC at 3rd Tier (+2 total), 4th Tier (+3 total), and 5th Tier (+4 total).\r\n\r\n### Superior Firepower\r\nAlso at 1st tier, your starship's firepower can overwhelm larger ships.\r\n\r\nWhen a crewmember deals damage to a Large or larger ship with a ship weapon, the crewmember can increase the damage by rolling a Superior Firepower die, which is a d4, and add it to the damage roll (no action required).\r\n\r\nYour ship's Superior Firepower die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be used a number of times equal to 3 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes recharging.\r\n\r\n### Role Specialization\r\nAt 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose any one from the following.\r\n\r\n#### Blockade Ship \r\nYour ship gains the Emergency Generator and Power Backup modifications at no cost. Additionally, your ships shields extend further around it. Whenever a friendly ship would take damage while within 500 feet of your ship, if the source of that damage is more than 500 feet away from your ship and your ship's shields are active, your ship's shields instead take that damage. If the damage reduces your ship's shields to 0, the protected ship takes any remaining damage.\r\n\r\n#### Flag Ship\r\nYour ship gains the Command Center suite and Tractor Beam modifications at no cost. Additionally, when a crewmember deployed in a command center takes the Direct action, the target of the Direct action can reroll one of the dice once.\r\n\r\n#### Industrial Center\r\nYour ship gains two Workshop modifications at no cost.  Additionally, the speed at which goods are crafted in your workshops is doubled.\r\n\r\n#### Mobile Metropolis\r\nYour ship gains a Living Quarters suite and a Recreation suite at no cost. Additionally, the capacity of your Living Quarters are doubled.\r\n\r\n#### Researcher \r\nYour ship gains the Laboratory and Workshop modifications at no cost. Additionally, Intelligence (Lore) checks on your ship are made with advantage.\r\n\r\n#### Warship\r\nYour ship gains two Fixed Hardpoint modifications at no cost. Additionally, your ship has a +1 bonus to damage rolls with ship weapons.\r\n\r\n### Prime Doctrine\r\nAlso at 2nd tier, your starship strikes fear in your enemies. When crewmembers roll initiative, one crewmember can attempt to frighten other ships. Each crewmember deployed on a hostile ship must make a Wisdom saving throw contested by a Charisma (Menace) check. On a failed save, affected crewmembers have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make each round for 1 minute. At the end of each of their turns, they repeat this save, ending this effect on a success. Additionally, on a successful save, they become immune to this feature for one day.\r\n\r\nOnce this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.\r\n\r\n### Versatile Dreadnought\r\nStarting at 3rd tier, when a crewmember makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A crewmember can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be used a number of times equal to 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship recharges.\r\n\r\n### Superweapon\r\nAlso at 3rd tier, your ship is equipped with a superweapon. As an action, a crewmember can activate the superweapon, which has a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. When activated, a beam of destructive energy forming a line 10,000 feet long and 100 feet wide blasts from the weapon. Each ship in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + the crewmember's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 15d10 energy damage, or half as much on a successful one.\r\n\r\nOnce this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.\r\n\r\n### Role Mastery\r\nAt 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose any one from the following.\r\n\r\n#### Blockade Ship\r\nYour ship's shield regeneration rate doubles.\r\n\r\n#### Flag Ship\r\nA crewmember deployed in a command center can, as an action, issue an order to a Huge or smaller ship. That ship can immediately move up to its flying speed, and up to five crewmembers on that ship can use their reaction to immediately take an action.\r\n\r\nOnce this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.\r\n\r\n#### Industrial Center\r\nYour ship gains two Docking Bay suites at no cost, which do not count against its total suite systems. Additionally, the capacity of your docking bays are doubled.\r\n\r\n#### Mobile Metropolis\r\nYour ship's fuel capacity, as shown in the Starship Size Fuel Capacity table, and storage capacity, as shown in the **Starship Size Storage Capacity** table, doubles. Additionally, while traveling in realspace, your ship consumes half the amount of fuel as normal.\r\n\r\n#### Researcher \r\nWhen you use your ship's Superweapon, you can alter its functionality. Instead of dealing damage, ships who fail a saving throw are blinded, ionized, and shocked for 1 minute. Ships who succeed on the saving throw suffer these effects until the start of your ship's next turn, instead.\r\n\r\n#### Warship\r\nWhen a crewmember on your ship rolls the maximum on a damage die for a ship weapon, they can roll an additional die.\r\n\r\n### Citadel\r\nAlso at 4th tier, the capacity for all of your suites is doubled.  If a suite type's capacity was already doubled, its size is instead tripled from its standard size. Additionally, your starship's maximum capacity for fuel and consumables doubles, and civilians, crewmembers, and troopers aboard your starship have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid Exhaustion.  If the capacity for fuel and/or consumables was already double its standard amount, it is now triple its original capacity.\r\n\r\n### Paragon Dreadnought\r\nAs of 5th tier, your starship is the best in its class. Two of your ship's ability scores increase by 4, and its maximum for these scores increase by 4.  Another ability score increases by 2, and its maximum for this score increases by 2.\r\n\r\n### Devastator\r\nAlso at 5th tier, as an action, a single crewmember can give the ship the following benefits for 1 minute:\r\n- Your ship has resistance to all damage.\r\n- Your ship's ship attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if the ship is disabled. Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes refitting.","contentTypeEnum":0,"contentType":"None","contentSourceEnum":4,"contentSource":"SotG","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"Gargantuan","timestamp":"2023-03-19T23:10:28.7470214+00:00","eTag":"W/\"datetime'2023-03-19T23%3A10%3A28.7470214Z'\""},{"name":"Huge","strength":0,"strengthModifier":0,"dexterity":0,"dexterityModifier":0,"constitution":0,"constitutionModifier":0,"hitDiceNumberOfDice":0,"hitDiceDieType":0,"hitDiceDieTypeEnum":0,"maxSuiteSystems":0,"modSlotsAtTier0":0,"stockModificationNames":null,"stockModificationNamesJson":"","stockModificationSuiteChoices":null,"stockModificationSuiteChoicesJson":"","startingEquipmentNonShield":null,"startingEquipmentNonShieldJson":"","startingEquipmentArmorChoices":null,"startingEquipmentArmorChoicesJson":"","modSlotsPerLevel":0,"additionalHitDiceText":null,"savingThrowOptions":null,"savingThrowOptionsJson":"","stockEquipmentNames":null,"stockEquipmentNamesJson":"","features":null,"featuresJson":"","flavorText":"The battleship's shields flicker as it absorbs the blows of the  attacking fighters.

You can't increase your ability scores other than Constitution above 20, or your Constitution above 22, with this feature.\r\n\r\n#### Additional Hull and Shield Dice\r\nYour ship gains 1 additional Hull Die and 1 additional Shield Die. It gains 1 additional Hull Die and 1 additional Shield Die at 2nd tier (2, each), 3rd tier (3, each), 4th tier (4, each), and 5th tier (5, each).\r\n\r\n#### Armor Class Improvement\r\nBeginning at second Tier, your ship's armor class improves, giving your ship a +1 to its AC.  It gains an additional +1 bonus to AC at 3rd Tier (+2 total), 4th Tier (+3 total), and 5th Tier (+4 total).\r\n\r\n### Blockade Runner\r\nAlso at 1st tier, your starship gains the ability to react to damage from large ships. \r\n\r\nAs a reaction to being hit with an attack roll from a Large or larger ship, a crewmember at the helm can use their reaction to immediately move the ship forward an amount equal to half its flying speed (rounded down) and then roll a Blockade Runner die, which is a d4, and subtract it from the triggering attack roll, potentially causing it to miss.\r\n\r\nYour ship's Blockade Runner die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be used a number of times equal to 3 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.\r\n\r\n### Role Specialization\r\nAt 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship.

Additionally, the range of its scanners is increased by 1,000 feet.\r\n\r\n#### Picket Ship\r\nYour ship can install a single point-defense primary weapon in a hardpoint.  This hardpoint may be modified to include more than a single limited firing arc.\r\n\r\n#### Ship's Tender\r\nYour ship gains a Fuel Storage modification at no cost.\r\n\r\n### Concentrated Fire\r\nAlso at 2nd tier, once per turn, when you attack a ship of size Large or larger, and it was previously hit by an allied ship of size Large or larger's weapons since the end of its last turn, you have advantage on the attack. If you already had advantage, you may instead reroll one of the dice once (your choice).\r\n\r\n### Versatile Frigate\r\nStarting at 3rd tier, when a crewmember makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw with the ship, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A crewmember can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be used a number of times equal to 3 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.\r\n\r\n### Super-Heavy Turbolaser Battery\r\nAlso at 3rd tier, your ship is equipped with a forward-mounted special version of a Turbolaser.  Your ship is considered to meet this weapon's constitution requirement regardless of your ship's constitution ability score.  The damage dealt by this Turbolaser is 3d12.\r\n\r\nThis weapon does not utilize or count as a weapon hardpoint.\r\n\r\n### Role Mastery\r\nAt 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.\r\n\r\n#### Ambassador\r\nYour ship has advantage on saving throws to avoid being rammed or tractored.\r\n\r\n#### Corvette\r\nYour ship's flying speed increases by 50 feet. \r\n\r\n#### Cruiser\r\nWhen firing a tertiary or quaternary weapon, you can load each weapon with multiple types of munitions up to your reload number and select which to fire when you take the attack action with that weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Explorer\r\nYour ship can detect ships moving through hyperspace with its scanners, and it ignores environmental effects that would impact its scanners.\r\n\r\n#### Picket Ship\r\nThe close and long ranges of your point defense systems increase by 100 feet. Additionally, Large or smaller ships have disadvantage on saving throws against your point defense systems.\r\n\r\n#### Ship's Tender\r\nYour ship gains the Nano-Droid Distributor modification at no cost. Additionally, the range of its effects is increased by 400 feet.\r\n\r\n### Tactical Retreat\r\nAlso at 4th tier, when a crewmember rolls a 1 on an Intelligence (Astrogation) check to calculate astrogation, or a Constitution saving throw to maintain the hyperdrive booting, they can reroll the die. They must use the new roll.\r\n\r\n### Paragon Frigate\r\nAs of 5th tier, your starship is the best in its class. Three of your ship's ability scores increase by 2. Its maximum for these scores increases by 2.\r\n\r\n### Spinal Mount\r\nAlso at 5th tier, once on each crewmember's turn, they can add the ship's Strength modifier to the attack roll or the ship's Intelligence modifier to the damage roll of an attack it makes. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.","contentTypeEnum":0,"contentType":"None","contentSourceEnum":4,"contentSource":"SotG","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"Large","timestamp":"2023-03-19T23:10:28.746023+00:00","eTag":"W/\"datetime'2023-03-19T23%3A10%3A28.746023Z'\""},{"name":"Medium","strength":0,"strengthModifier":0,"dexterity":0,"dexterityModifier":0,"constitution":0,"constitutionModifier":0,"hitDiceNumberOfDice":0,"hitDiceDieType":0,"hitDiceDieTypeEnum":0,"maxSuiteSystems":0,"modSlotsAtTier0":0,"stockModificationNames":null,"stockModificationNamesJson":"","stockModificationSuiteChoices":null,"stockModificationSuiteChoicesJson":"","startingEquipmentNonShield":null,"startingEquipmentNonShieldJson":"","startingEquipmentArmorChoices":null,"startingEquipmentArmorChoicesJson":"","modSlotsPerLevel":0,"additionalHitDiceText":null,"savingThrowOptions":null,"savingThrowOptionsJson":"","stockEquipmentNames":null,"stockEquipmentNamesJson":"","features":null,"featuresJson":"","flavorText":"The freighter shudders with the blasts of cannon fire.

This movement happens before the initiative order is determined.\r\n\r\nThe amount the ship moves is determined by rolling an Evasive Maneuvers die, which is a d4, and multiplying it by 50 feet. The ship then gains that many feet that it can move or spend to turn.\r\n\r\nYour ship's Evasive Maneuvers die changes when it reaches certain tiers.

Additionally, while hosting guests on your ship, they have disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks.\r\n\r\n### Nimble Starship\r\nAlso at 2nd tier, your ship can add half its Dexterity modifier (minimum of one) to any saving throw it makes that doesn't already include that modifier.\r\n\r\n### Versatile Transport\r\nStarting at 3rd tier, when a crewmember makes, with the ship, an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A crewmember can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be used a number of times equal to 2x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.\r\n\r\n### Hold Together\r\nAlso at 3rd tier, when your ship takes damage while at 0 hull points, it makes a Destruction saving throw, instead of automatically failing.\r\n\r\n### Role Mastery\r\nAt 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose any one from the following.\r\n\r\n#### Courier\r\nYour ship gains the Backup Hyperdrive modification at no cost.  Any installed hyperdrive operates as one of the next faster class.  If you have a class 0.5 hyperdrive installed, it acts as a 0.4 hyperdrive. \r\n\r\n#### Freighter\r\nWhen your ship fails a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, a crewmember can use their reaction to jettison some of the cargo stored in its storage compartments. If you jettison at least 50 tons of cargo, you can reroll the saving throw and must use the new roll. If you jettison at least 75 tons of cargo, however, you instead automatically succeed on the saving throw. Additionally, the area in a line 300 feet long and 100 feet wide behind your ship becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.\r\n\r\n#### Gunship\r\nOnce per round, a crewmember can roll the weapon damage dice one additional time when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ship attack.\r\n\r\n#### Missile Boat\r\nWhen firing a tertiary or quaternary weapon, you can load each weapon with multiple types of munitions up to your reload number and select which to fire when you take the attack action with that weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Navigator\r\nYour ship has resistance to damage from environmental effects, and advantage on saving throws to resist the effects of environmental effects.\r\n\r\n#### Yacht\r\nYou have advantage Charisma checks made against those who can see your ship.\r\n\r\n### Adaptive Armor\r\nAlso at 4th tier, when your ship is hit with an attack roll, a crewmember at the helm can add the ship's Constitution modifier to AC, potentially causing the attack to miss.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.\r\n\r\n### Paragon Transport\r\nAs of 5th tier, your starship is the best in its class.  Two of your ship's ability scores increase by 2.  It's maximums for these scores increase by two.\r\n\r\n### Best Ship in the 'Verse\r\nAlso at 5th tier, as an action, a crewmember can give the ship resistance to unenhanced damage from ship weapons for 1 minute.\r\n\r\nThis effect ends early if the ship is disabled. Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.","contentTypeEnum":0,"contentType":"None","contentSourceEnum":4,"contentSource":"SotG","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"Medium","timestamp":"2023-03-19T23:10:28.746023+00:00","eTag":"W/\"datetime'2023-03-19T23%3A10%3A28.746023Z'\""},{"name":"Small","strength":0,"strengthModifier":0,"dexterity":0,"dexterityModifier":0,"constitution":0,"constitutionModifier":0,"hitDiceNumberOfDice":0,"hitDiceDieType":0,"hitDiceDieTypeEnum":0,"maxSuiteSystems":0,"modSlotsAtTier0":0,"stockModificationNames":null,"stockModificationNamesJson":"","stockModificationSuiteChoices":null,"stockModificationSuiteChoicesJson":"","startingEquipmentNonShield":null,"startingEquipmentNonShieldJson":"","startingEquipmentArmorChoices":null,"startingEquipmentArmorChoicesJson":"","modSlotsPerLevel":0,"additionalHitDiceText":null,"savingThrowOptions":null,"savingThrowOptionsJson":"","stockEquipmentNames":null,"stockEquipmentNamesJson":"","features":null,"featuresJson":"","flavorText":"\r\nAs the fighters cover his approach, Zik Beskin activates his   \r\ntargeting computer and ignores the explosions surrounding him, instead Focusing on the Destroyer's shield generator.

You can't increase your ability scores other than Dexterity above 20, or your Dexterity above 22, with this feature.\r\n\r\n#### Additional Hull and Shield Dice\r\nYour ship gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die. It gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die at 2nd tier (2, each), 3rd tier (3, each), 4th tier (4, each), and 5th tier (5, each).\r\n\r\n#### ARMOR CLASS IMPROVEMENT\r\nBeginning at second Tier, your ship's armor class improves, giving your ship a +1 to its AC. It gains an additional +1 bonus to AC at 3rd Tier (+2 total), 4th Tier (+3 total), and 5th Tier (+4 total).\r\n\r\n### Pinpoint Strike\r\nAlso at 1st tier, your starship gains the ability to slip underneath the shields of an enemy ship.\r\n\r\nWhen your ship occupies the same square occupied by a target ship and the crewmember at the helm makes an attack roll, as a reaction, they can, before rolling the attack, roll a Pinpoint Strike die, which is a d4, and add it to the attack roll.  If the attack requires a saving throw instead, you may subtract the Pinpoint Strike die from the target's save result.  On a hit or a failed save, the attack deals normal damage that bypasses any shields and directly hits the hull of the target ship. This feature can only be used once per round.\r\n\r\nYour ship's Pinpoint Strike die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier.

Your Starship Size Suite Capacity for this suite is 2.  Your maximum suites is a minimum of 1.\r\n\r\n#### Superiority Fighter\r\nYour ship's flying speed increases by 50 feet.\r\n\r\n### Retro Thrusters\r\nAlso at 2nd tier, when an attacker that a crewmember can see deals damage to your ship with a weapon, they can use their reaction to immediately move the ship up to 50 feet in a direction of their choice, halving the damage your ship takes. The orientation of the ship does not change.\r\n\r\nOnce this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.\r\n\r\n### Versatile Snubfighter\r\nStarting at 3rd tier, when a crewmember makes, with the ship, an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A crewmember can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.\r\n\r\n### Auto-Thrusters\r\nAlso at 3rd tier, your ship can add half of its Strength\r\nmodifier (rounded down, minimum of one) to its Dexterity Saving Throws.\r\n\r\n### Role Mastery\r\nAt 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship.

Your Starship Size Suite Capacity for this suite is 2.  Your maximum suites is a minimum of 2.\r\n\r\n#### Superiority Fighter\r\nYour ship's turning speed decreases by 50 feet. If this would decrease your ship's turning speed to 0, instead your ship's flying speed increases by 50 feet.\r\n\r\n### Standing By\r\nAlso at 4th tier, your ship can be pushed beyond its normal limits for a moment. On their turn, a crewmember can take one additional action on top of their regular action and a possible bonus action.\r\n\r\nOnce this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship recharges.\r\n\r\n### Paragon Snubfighter\r\nAs of 5th tier, your starship is the best in its class.

You can't increase your ability scores other than Dexterity above 20, or your Dexterity above 24, with this feature.\r\n\r\n#### Additional Hull and Shield Dice\r\nYour ship gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die. It gains 1 additional Hull Die and one additional Shield Die at 2nd tier (2, each), 3rd tier (3, each), 4th tier (4, each), and 5th tier (5, each).\r\n\r\n#### ARMOR CLASS UPGRADE\r\nBeginning at second Tier, your ship's armor class improves, giving your ship a +1 to its AC. It gains an additional +1 bonus to AC at 3rd Tier (+2 total), 4th Tier (+3 total), and 5th Tier (+4 total).\r\n\r\n### Swarm Tactics\r\nAlso at 1st tier, your starship is most effective when working in groups.\r\n\r\nYour ship makes the most of every opportunity provided by allies. When a crewmember at the helm would make an attack roll against a larger ship, and there is an allied ship within 200 feet of your target, they can roll a Swarm Tactics die, which is a d4, and add it to the attack roll. You can do this after the roll is made, but before the result is known.\r\n\r\nYour ship's Swarm Tactics die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier and a d12 at 5th tier.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be used a number of times equal to 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship is refitted.\r\n\r\n### Role Specialization\r\nAt 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship.

Once this feature has been used, your ship must recharge before it can use it again.\r\n\r\n#### Munition\r\nYour ship gains the Hardened Prow modification at no cost.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you deal damage on a ram, the damage you inflict on other ships increases by +2 per hull die of your ship.\r\n\r\n#### Predator\r\nOnce per turn, your ship can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one ship it hits with a primary weapon if your ship has advantage on the attack roll. This damage is the same as the weapon’s damage, and the attack must use a weapon without a constitution requirement.\r\n\r\nYour ship doesn’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 50 feet of it, that enemy isn’t disabled, and your ship doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll\r\n\r\n#### Probe\r\nYour ship gains the Scanner, Mk I modification at no cost.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, when your ship attacks a ship or creature it can’t see, its inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on its attack rolls against it.\r\n\r\n#### Satellite\r\nYour ship gains the Comms Package, Mk I modification at no cost.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can take the Interfere action as a bonus action.\r\n\r\n#### Worker\r\nYour ship gains the Tractor Beam modification at no cost.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your ship is treated as a medium ship for purposes of this modification.\r\n\r\n### Nimble Aerobatics\r\nAlso at 2nd tier, your ship is so nimble that it can ignore unenhanced difficult terrain, and when it you would use an action to break free of an effect that is tractoring or otherwise restraining your ship, you can instead use a bonus action.\r\n\r\n### Uncanny Dodge\r\nAt 3rd tier, your ship's agility lets it dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When your ship is subjected to an effect, such as a proton torpedo or a seismic charge, that allows your ship to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on a saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.\r\n\r\n### Swarm Defense\r\nAlso at 3rd tier, your ship further benefits from being surrounded by allies. Your ship gains a bonus its to AC equal to number of allied ships within 100 feet of it. The bonus has a maximum value equal to your ship's tier (rounded up).\r\n\r\n### Role Specialization\r\nAt 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose any one from the following.\r\n\r\n#### Droid\r\nYour ship gains the Droid Brain, Mk II modification at no cost.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, your ship can take a second reaction each round. It can only take one reaction per turn.\r\n\r\n#### Munition\r\nYour ship gains the Self-Destruct Mechanism modification at no cost.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when you deal damage upon self-destruction, the damage you inflict on other ships increases by +2 per hull die of your ship.\r\n\r\n#### Predator\r\nYour ship deals 1d6 additional damage when it scores a critical hit with an attack.\r\n\r\n#### Probe\r\nYour ship gains the Stealth Device modification at no cost.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when your ship attempts to conceal on its turn, it can opt to not move on that turn causing creatures that attempt to detect your ship to take a -10 penalty to their Wisdom (Scan) checks until the start of your ship's next turn. Your ship loses this benefit if it moves, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. \r\n\r\n#### Satellite\r\nYour ship gains the Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk I and Electromagnetic Scrambler, Mk II modifications at no cost.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the range of these modifications is 1200 feet.\r\n\r\n#### Worker\r\nYour ship gains the Tractor Beam Heavy Capacitors modification at no cost.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your ship is treated as a medium ship for purposes of this modification.\r\n\r\n### Elusive Target\r\nAlso at 4th tier, the size and agility of your ship makes it easy to avoid attacks. No primary weapon attacks made against your ship can benefit from advantage while your ship is not disabled.\r\n\r\n### Paragon Swarmer\r\nAs of 5th Tier, your starship is the best in its class. Choose from the following:\r\n\r\n#### Droid\r\nYour ship’s Intelligence score increases by 2.
