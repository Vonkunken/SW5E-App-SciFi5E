As these campaigns progress, you might want to introduce mechanics to reflect your characters' natural aging. Alternatively, at character creation, you might want to create a character who is already at a later stage in life. Regardless of when your characters have aged, consider using the following variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Aging Thresholds\r\nEvery species ages at a different rate. While many near-human species age at the same rate as humans, reaching adulthood in their late teens, middle age in their 40's, elderly in their late 50's to early 60's, and venerability in their 70's, other species age differently. For instance, lanniks reach adulthood in their 50's and can live up to 900 years, while hutts aren't considered adults until they reach 200 years old and can live to be over a thousand.\r\n\r\nConsequently, rather than tying aging to numbers, we instead establish three thresholds: Middle-Age, Elderly, and Venerable. Each time a character reaches one of these thresholds, they gain one or more aging quirks and one or more aging boons, determined by the threshold they've reached. When they do so, the GM can determine choose which quirk and boon they get, or determine it randomly, using the Aging Quirks and Aging Boons tables below:\r\n\r\n##### Aging Quirks\r\n\r\n|d4|Quirk|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|Your Strength score decreases by 1. Your maximum for this score decreases by 1.|\r\n|2|Your Dexterity score decreases by 1. Your maximum for this score decreases by 1.|\r\n|3|Your Constitution score decreases by 1. Your maximum for this score decreases by 1.|\r\n|4|Your base walking speed decreases by 5 feet.|\r\n\r\n##### Aging Boons\r\n\r\n|d4|Boon|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|Your Intelligence score increases by 1. Your maximum for this score increases by 1.|\r\n|2|Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Your maximum for this score increases by 1.|\r\n|3|Your Charisma score increases by 1. Your maximum for this score increases by 1.|\r\n|4|You gain proficiency in a language, skill, tool, or weapon of your choice.|\r\n\r\nThese effects are cumulative. When a middle-aged character, who has one quirk and one boon, becomes elderly, they gain two more quirks and two more boons, for a total of three of each. Additionally, duplicates are only rerolled at separate thresholds. If, at middle-age, your Strength score decreased by 1, your Strength score could again decrease by 1 at elderly.\r\n\r\n#### Middle-Aged\r\nMost species enter middle age about halfway through their expected life. For humans and near-humans, this is typically in their 40's, while lanniks don't reach middle age until about 400 years, and hutts at about 600 years. When a character reaches middle age, the GM should choose one quirk and one boon. Alternatively, they can determine the quirk and boon randomly. \r\n\r\n#### Elderly\r\nLike middle age, at which age a species becoming elderly also varies. For humans and near-humans, this is typically in their late 50's to early 60's, while lanniks are considered elderly at about 600, and hutts at about 750 years. When a character becomes elderly, the GM should choose two quirks and two boons. Alternatively, they can determine the quirks and boons randomly, rerolling any duplicates.\r\n\r\n#### Venerable\r\nVenerable members of a species are rare and typically revered by the younger members of their species. Humans and near-humans become\r\nin their 70's, lanniks at about 750, and hutts over the age of 900. When a character becomes venerable, the GM should choose three quirks and three boons. Alternatively, they can determine the quirks and boons randomly, rerolling any duplicates.\r\n\r\n> #### Additional Aging Traits\r\n> Some species gain additional traits as they age. For instance, hutts have the unique special characteristic in that they never stop growing from birth to death. The GM can add quirks and boons as appropriate for members of those species.

Specifically, **Force Powers Known**, **Force Points**, and **Forcecasting Ability** will want to be replaced with **Tech Powers Known**, **Tech Points**, and **Techcasting Ability**, and vice versa, as described below:\r\n\r\n> Note that Max Power Level is not mentioned because it is not affected by these changes.\r\n\r\n- **Consular:** Replace consular Forcecasting with engineer Techcasting.\r\n- **Engineer:** Replace engineer Techcasting with consular Forcecasting.\r\n- **Guardian:** Replace guardian Forcecasting with scout Techcasting.\r\n- **Scout:** Replace scout Techcasting with guardian Forcecasting. Mechanist scout should instead replace Improved Techcasting with sentinel Forcecasting.\r\n- **Sentinel:** Replace sentinel Forcecasting with the Improved Techcasting present in the Mechanist Technique scout archetype, with the following updates: sentinels will have 5 and 6 tech powers known, and 2 and 3 tech points, at 1st and 2nd levels, respectively.\r\n- **Splashcasters:** Replace Forcecasting with Techcasting, and vice versa, of the other splashcasting archetype for that class. For instance, Shield Specialist fighter would replace its Techcasting feature with Adept Specialist fighter's forcecasting.\r\n\r\n> For the crosscaster archetypes, such as Way of Technology consular, you can simply flip the powers accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Class Features\r\nDifferent classes or archetypes with casting as a core component are typically built around that casting's primary ability score. You'll want to update or replace them, as appropriate to the class or archetype, including capstones.\r\n\r\n### Short or Long Rest Recovery\r\nYou can also consider swapping the point recovery rest requirements, creating short rest force points or long rest tech points. To do so, you'll want to halve the base number of force points (not accounting for ability modifier) to account for short rest recovery, or double the base number of tech points (again not accounting for ability modifier) to account for long rest recovery. For instance, a consular with long rest forcecasting gets four tech points for each consular level (before modifier). If you wanted to do a short rest forcecasting consular instead, you'd only receive two tech points per consular level. The opposite would be true for an engineer; while they would get two tech points per engineer level as with short rest recovery techcasting, they would instead get four tech points per engineer level for long rest casting (again, ignoring additional tech points from their ability modifier).\r\n\r\nNote that if you are only swapping the rest mechanics, this has no impact on powers known or casting ability, as discussed earlier in this variant rule.\r\n\r\n> #### Sundry Sidney\r\n> For those of you watching A Starstruck Odyssey, Sundry Sidney is a sentinel using techcasting instead of forcecasting. While they swapped the powers known, type of points, and casting ability, they maintained the long rest recovery of points. Consequently, she kept the three points per level a sentinel would normally receive, instead of halving the number received as with Improved Techcasting present in the Mechanist Scout archetype.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Alternative Armor","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nTraditionally, armor class is designed entirely for avoidance. While unarmored or lightly armored, that's dodging the attack entirely. In medium or heavy armor, however, that's absorbing the attack on your armor in such a way that it deals no damage. If you want a different approach to armor, try this variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Armor Class (AC)\r\nBase armor class (AC), without consideration of any special traits, class features, or armor and shields, is always calculated as 10 + Dexterity modifier, with armor replacing or augmenting that base AC calculation. Using this system, your base armor class is instead calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Base AC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Damage Reduction (DR)\r\nDamage reduction (DR) is a static value that you subtract when you take damage if certain conditions are met. Certain features, such as the Defense fighting mastery or the absorptive armor property, grant DR that only applies when you take damage from weapons. DR is expressed as a number. DR provided by armor only affects damage you take as a result of being hit by an attack roll, in the same way that AC only helps you avoid being hit by an attack roll.\r\n\r\nIf passive DR would reduce the damage you take to 0, you instead take 1 damage.\r\n\r\n### Armor Class vs. Damage Reduction\r\nInstead of focusing solely on damage avoidance, this variant rule balances armor class and damage reduction, to better emphasize how armor is used. Each type of armor affects your AC and DR differently, as shown below.\r\n\r\n#### Light Armor\r\nAs normal, light armor does not prohibit the maximum Dexterity bonus you can receive to your AC. However, if the light armor had a higher base AC, extra AC instead becomes damage reduction (DR).\r\n\r\nFor instance, fiber armor normally increases your AC to 12 + Dexterity modifier. If you have a Dexterity modifier of +3, while wearing fiber armor you would have an AC of 15. With this variant rule, however, fiber armor instead grants you DR of 2 while allowing you to add your Dexterity modifier to your AC. If you have a proficiency bonus of +2, you would have an AC of 13 (8 + your proficiency bonus of +2 and your Dexterity modifier of +3) and DR of 2. \r\n\r\n#### Medium Armor\r\nMedium armor strikes a balance between AC and DR. As normal, it still allows you to add up to +2 to your AC if your Dexterity modifier is +2 or higher.\r\n\r\nFor instance, weave armor normally increases your AC to 14 + Dexterity modifier (max 2). If you have a Dexterity modifier of +2 or higher, while wearing weave armor you would have an AC of 16. With this variant \r\n\r\nrule, however, weave armor instead grants you DR of 4 while allowing you to add your Dexterity modifier (max 2) to your AC. If you have a proficiency bonus of +2, you would have an AC of 12 (8 + your proficiency bonus of +2 and your Dexterity modifier of +2) and DR of 4. \r\n\r\n#### Heavy Armor\r\nHeavy armor focuses entirely on DR. You gain no benefit to AC from your Dexterity modifier, but you also aren't penalized if your Dexterity modifier is negative.\r\n\r\nFor instance, assault armor normally increases your AC to 17. With this variant rule, however, assault armor instead grants you DR of 7, but it grants no benefit to your AC. If you have a proficiency bonus of +2, you would have an AC of 10 (8 + your proficiency bonus of +2) and DR of 7. \r\n\r\n#### Unarmored Defense and Natural Armor\r\nCertain species (such as wookie or colicoid), classes (such as monk or berserker), or archetypes (such as Blademaster Specialist fighter) grant unarmored defense or natural armor. When using this variant, the following rules apply.\r\n\r\n***Unarmored Defense.*** If your unarmored defense includes Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, you add that modifier to your AC as normal. If your unarmored defense includes your Constitution modifier, however, you instead treat that modifier as DR. For instance, a monk with a proficiency bonus of +2, a Dex modifier of +4, and a Wisdom modifier of +3 would have an AC of 17. A berserker with a proficiency bonus of +2, a Dex modifier of +4, and a Constitution modifier of +3, however, would have an AC of 14 and DR of 3. \r\n\r\n***Natural Armor.*** If your natural armor includes an adjustment to your base AC, that adjustment instead becomes DR. If your natural armor allows you to add your Dexterity modifier to your AC, you still add it as normal. For instance, a wookiee's hide grants them a base AC of 13 + Dexterity modifier. If the wookiee has a proficiency bonus of +2 and a Dexterity modifier of +2, instead of having an AC of 15 they would have an AC of 12 and DR of 3. A colicoid, however, who would have an AC of 17, with a proficiency bonus of +2, would have an AC of 10 and a DR of 7.\r\n\r\n#### Shields\r\nAs normal, shields add their bonus to AC.\r\n\r\n#### Enhanced Items\r\nIf an enhanced armor would add an additional bonus to AC, it instead increases DR. If an enhanced shield would add an additional bonus to AC, it continues to do so. If that bonus only applies to melee or ranged AC, it still only applies to melee or ranged AC or DR, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n#### Other AC Calculations\r\nWork with your GM to determine how other AC calculations, such as the *battle precognition* power or Way of Endurance consular's Upheld by the Force feature, should translate using these rules.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Alternative At-Wills and Extra Attack","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nOne of my many gripes with 5e is that its cantrips scale with character level. I find that this doesn't make sense both mechanically and logically; if I multiclass 2 levels of fighter and 3 levels of warlock, I don't magically get Extra Attack, but for some reason I can create two beams when I cast *eldritch blast*. If you want to try alternative at-will power scaling, consider this variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Caster Level\r\nInstead of having at-will powers that improve at 5th, 11th, and 17th *character* level, instead have them scale at 5th, 11th, and 17th *caster* level. Caster level is, effectively, what you're calculating when you are determining your Max Power Level while multiclassing. \r\n\r\nTo determine your caster level, you divide your class's potential Max Power Level by 9, and then multiply the result by your number of levels in that class. That number is your caster level. For the full-caster classes�consular and engineer�this will be the same as your level in that class. For other casting classes and archetypes, your caster level will be lower than your level in that class.\r\n\r\nWhen multiclassing, you determine your caster level by dividing each class's potential Max Power Level by 9, multiplying the result by the number of levels in that class, adding the results for each class together, and rounding down the final result. For instance, if you have four levels in Marauder Approach berserker (1.77) and three levels in guardian (1.67), your caster level is 3.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nUltimately, the results of this variant rule mean that a 20th-level fighter who took the Force-Sensitive feat and the *shock* force power is no longer as potent with *shock* as a 20th-level consular. Both mechanically and flavorfully, this aligns to me. Additionally, it means the consular who focuses on the Force is also better with their at-will powers than an equal level guardian or sentinel, which again makes more sense mechanically and flavorfully. \r\n\r\n> ##### Favored At-Wills\r\n> Some archetypes, such as most sentinel archetypes or Soresu guardian, are built around a specific at-will. Your GM might consider letting characters of that archetype use native scaling. However, if adopting this variant rule, they should only scale with class level in this way, rather than character level.\r\n\r\n### Multiclassing Extra Attack\r\nIf using this variant rule, you might consider allowing characters who multiclass in classes with the Extra Attack feature to add their class levels together to gain that feature. Their combined level in those classes must satisfy the level requirement in both classes to receive this benefit, however. \r\n\r\nFor instance, a character with 2 levels in fighter and 3 levels in berserker would be eligible for Extra Attack, since their combined levels would meet the 5th-level requirement for Extra Attack in both classes. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a character with 2 levels in fighter and 3 levels in armormech engineer, would not be eligible for Extra Attack, since their combined levels levels don't meet the 6th-level requirement for Extra Attack in armormech engineer. If that character gains an additional level in either class, or a level in another class with the Extra Attack feature, however, they would now meet the requirements for Extra Attack in all three classes, and thus would gain the feature.\r\n\r\nIf a class or archetype has a restriction to their Extra Attack feature, such as armormech engineer requiring that you are wearing your modified armor or wielding your modified shield to gain the benefit, the character must meet that requirement to gain the benefits of Extra Attack while multiclassing.\r\n\r\n#### Greater Extra Attack\r\nNo characters should receive the Greater Extra Attack feature through this multiclassing variant, since that feature is exclusive to fighter.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Ammunition Sizes","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nFor the sake of simplicity, ammunition is shared amongst weapons that deal the same damage type. For instance, all blasters that deal kinetic damage utilize slug cartridges, while all blasters that deal energy, ion, or other elemental damage types utilize power cells. If you dislike that an assault cannon and a blaster pistol utilize the same ammunition, consider the following variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Damage Dice Ammo Size\r\nSlug cartridges and power cells are each broken down into five size categories, from Tiny to Huge. These new sized ammunitions only fit in weapons that utilize certain damage values, as shown in the below table.\r\n\r\n|Ammo Size|Damage Dice|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|Tiny|d4|\r\n|Small|d6|\r\n|Medium|d8/2d4|\r\n|Large|d10\r\n|Huge|d12/2d6/3d4|\r\n\r\nFor those weapons with alternative damage types, you'll want to treat their damage as one step higher. Ion damage should be two steps higher or twice the weapon's damage, whichever is lower.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a blaster which deals 1d8 energy damage would use Medium power cells, while a blaster that deals 1d4 kinetic damage would use Tiny slug cartridges. A blaster that deals 1d4 fire damage, however, would use Small power cells (since we treat that damage as one step higher), as would a blaster that deals 1d3 ion damage (since we treat that damage as two steps higher).\r\n\r\n### Ammo Size Values and Weights\r\nAdditionally, the value and weight of these sized munitions would scale, as shown in the table below.\r\n\r\n|\tItem\t|\tCost\t|\tWeight\t\t|\r\n|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|\t_Ammunition_\t|\t\t|\t\t\t|\r\n|\tPower cell (Tiny)            \t    |\t  3 cr\t|\t1/4 lb\t\t|\r\n|\tPower cell (Small)            \t|\t  5 cr\t|\t1/2 lb\t\t|\r\n|\tPower cell (Medium)            \t|\t  10 cr\t|\t1 lb\t\t|\r\n|\tPower cell (Large)            \t|\t  20 cr\t|\t2 lb\t\t|\r\n|\tPower cell (Huge)                \t|\t  50 cr\t|\t5 lb\t\t|\r\n|\tSlug cartridge (Tiny)             |\t   1/2 cr\t|\t�\t\t|\r\n|\tSlug cartridge (Small)            |\t   1 cr\t|\t�\t\t|\r\n|\tSlug cartridge (Medium)           |\t   2 cr\t|\t�\t\t|\r\n|\tSlug cartridge (Large)            |\t   4 cr\t|\t1/4\tlb\t|\r\n|\tSlug cartridge (Huge)             |\t   10 cr\t|\t1/2 lb\t\t|\r\n\r\n> #### Powered by Power Cells\r\n> Items that are powered by power cells, such as jetpacks or glowrods, would utilize Medium power cells.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Bonus Action Consumables","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nMost consumables require an action to use, which makes sense when applying them to others.

Using this variant rule, you can add additional proficiencies in tools and languages to your players beyond those offered by their species, class, or background.\r\n\r\n### Proficiency Points\r\nEach character gains a number of proficiency points equal to their proficiency bonus. These proficiency points can be spent to learn languages or tool proficiencies at a ratio of 1 point per language or tool.\r\n\r\n#### Tool Expertise\r\nIf a character wants to instead use their points to gain expertise in a tool, the GM might allow them to spend 2 proficiency points to gain expertise in a tool in which they are already proficient.\r\n\r\n### When Are They Chosen?\r\nEach character can choose to spend their proficiency points at any time to gain proficiency in a language or tool. If they would do so in a moment when that language or proficiency would become relevant to the story, they must first justify how they already know that language or tool proficiency. For instance, if the party encounters a particular species from which they need to glean information, and they have no way to communicate with that species, one of your players might spend a proficiency point to learn the language that species speaks. In order to do so, however, they must first explain how they would know that language. Perhaps they grew up with a wandering member of that species who taught it to them? Or maybe they took this specific language as an elective during their education?\r\n\r\n### Alternative Proficiencies\r\nAlternatively, you might allow your players to spend their proficiency points to gain proficiency in weapons or armor. A character could spend 1 proficiency point to gain proficiency in a singular weapon, or 2 proficiency points to gain proficiency in a weapon category (all blasters, lightweapons, or vibroweapons). A character could also spend 2 proficiency points to gain proficiency in a type of armor. However, they would first need to have proficiency in the lesser armors.

On a failure, the weapons are not separated, you must wait 24 hours before you can try again, and you must roll a d20. If you roll a 1 on the d20, one currently combined weapon is destroyed. The GM should determine which weapon is destroyed randomly.\r\n\r\n### Combined Weapons\r\nOnce you've combined two weapons, you can readily switch between each weapon by using your object interaction on your turn. The combined weapon's weight is equal to the total weight of each individual part, and each weapon uses the appropriate damage and properties as shown in its statistics in the Weapons table.\r\n \r\nFor instance, a 3rd-level character decides they want to combine a greatsaber and a doublesaber. They have both weapons available, as well as a set of artificer's tools. After spending one hour, they make an ability check with the tools, resulting in a 17. The weapons are successfully combined, and using their object interaction each turn, the character can switch from a greatsaber to a doublesaber, or back again.\r\n\r\nWhen the character reaches 5th level, they decide they want to add a lightwhip to the mix. They obtain a lightwhip, and attempt to combine it with their current weapon over the course of an hour with their artificer's tools. At the end of the hour, however, they only roll an 8 on the check, failing to combine the third weapon. They must wait until tomorrow to try again.\r\n\r\n#### Blasters\r\nUnlike light- and vibro-weapons, you can't combine multiple blasters. Instead, you can integrate a wrist launcher attachment to a blaster, as long as the weapon lacks the fixed property. This attachment can fire all wrist launcher ammunition with a range of 20/40, or it can fire grenades with a range of 40/80. This attachment has a reload value of 2, it can have different ammunition types loaded simultaneously, and you can choose which ammunition you're using as you fire it (no action required). Each ammunition must be reloaded separately.\r\n\r\nWhen you would attempt to combine an additional weapon, you can instead attempt to increase this attachment's reload property by making an ability check with the appropriate tool and consulting the Combination/Separation DC by Weapons table.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Compound Advantage","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"Typically, multiple instances of advantage or disadvantage don't stack; you either have it or you don't, and if you have both, you essentially have neither. This variant rule is designed to allow sources of advantage�and disadvantage�to stack, to a maximum of three times.\r\nT\r\nWhen you have two sources of advantage, you instead have **superadvantage**, which allows you to roll two additional d20s when you make your ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, and take the highest of the three dice. If you have three sources of advantage, however, you instead have **hyperadvantage**, which allows you to roll three additionals d20s and take the highest of the four. Consequently, if you have two sources of disadvantage, you instead have **superdisadvantage**, and if you have three sources of disadvantage, you have **hyperdisadvantage**, rolling three and four d20s, respectively, and taking the lowest.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, advantage and disadvantage no longer completely cancel each other out. Instead, if you have two sources of advantage and one source of disadvantage, you instead have one source of advantage. For instance, if you are hidden from a creature, and an ally within 5 feet of it takes the Help action, you would have two sources of advantage�superadvantage�when you make your attack roll. If the creature is heavily obscured from you, however, you would have disadvantage on the attack roll, shifting you from superadvantage to advantage.\r\n\r\nEach source of advantage or disadvantage must be unique. For instance, if you are hidden from a creature, and an ally within 5 feet of it takes the Help action, you would have two sources of advantage�superadvantage�when you make your attack roll. If another ally also takes the Help action, however, you still only have two unique sources of advantage, thus granting only superadvantage.\r\n\r\n> Some customization options, such as the Supreme Accuracy feat, grant bonuses if you would have advantage. If you elect to use this variant rule, adjust these customization options to instead grant an additional source of advantage if you would already have advantage. For instance, if you have the Supreme Accuracy feat, if you have no source of advantage, you gain no benefit from the second bullet of the feat. If you have a source of advantage, however, the feat instead grants you superadvantage (or potentially hyperadvantage if you have an additional source of advantage).\r\n\r\n### Passive Checks\r\nWhen determining your total for a passive check with this variant rule, if you have superadvantage on a check, add 8. For superdisadvantage, subtract 8. If you have hyperadvantage on a check, add 10, and if you have hyperdisadvantage, subtract 10.\r\n\r\n### Careful Checks\r\nIf you would have superadvantage on a careful check, you can instead take 18. If you have hyperadvantage on a check, you can instead take 20.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Compound Checks","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nOccasionally, as GM, you might put forth a task for your players that is more difficult than they might be prepared for, and that task might have multiple ways to accomplish it, such as asking your operative to make an ability check to conceal a device on a highly perceptive individual. This task could be reasonable accomplished with a (Dexterity) Sleight of Hand check or a Charisma (Deception) check. Rather than choosing between the two possible checks, the player could elect to do both. If they do so, they must make two separate ability checks, but the target DC for the checks should be reduced by 5.\r\n\r\nFor instance, using the above example, you might set the DC for the initial check to be 25, allowing the character to perform a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check or Charisma (Deception) check. The player might instead decide to attempt both checks. If they do so, they must instead succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check and a DC 20 Charisma (Deception) check. If they succeed on both checks, they accomplish their task. If the fail on either check, they fail the task regardless of the outcome of the other check.\r\n\r\n### Minimum DC\r\nFor even more difficult tasks with multiple possible solutions, characters can attempt even more ability checks. For each ability check beyond the first, the DC should decrease by 5, cumulatively, to a minimum DC of 20. For instance, a DC 30 check could instead be accomplished by two separate DC 25 ability checks or even three DC 20 ability checks, provided there are sufficient different ability checks that could apply.\r\n\r\n### Degrees of Failure\r\nYou might also consider implementing degrees of failure if a character attempts to perform compound checks and fails one or more of them. For instance, if a character attempts a compound check with two separate ability checks and fails on one or both, you might determine the outcome for failing both to be significantly worse than only failing one.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Critical Saving Throws","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nUnlike attack rolls, which have critical hits and critical misses, saving throws don't have critical successes or failures. Using this variant rule, you can allow critical successes and failures on saving throws.\r\n\r\n### Critical Success\r\nWhen a creature rolls a 20 on their saving throw against an effect, they automatically succeed on the saving throw, even if the result of their save would not meet or exceed the save DC. Additionally, if they would suffer any effects on a successful save, such as half damage, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the minimum.\r\n\r\n### Critical Failure\r\nWhen a creature rolls a 1 on their saving throw against an effect, they automatically fail the saving throw, even if the result of their save would meet or exceed the save DC. Additionally, if the effect would deal damage, they treat the effect's damage as if it had rolled the maximum.\r\n\r\n### Features That Grant Critical Saves\r\nCertain features, such as the Explosives fighting style or the Heavy Weapon Specialization feat, grant the ability for certain saving throws to deal critical damage. If you are using this variant rule, instead have them expand the critical hit range by 1. For instance, while using this variant rule, a character with the Explosives fighting style would have a critical hit range of 2 on their grenades. Consequently, creatures that roll a 1 or a 2 on the saving throw against their grenades would critically fail their saves.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can consider allowing weapons with the keen property to increase the critical hit range of their burst or rapid properties.\r\n\r\n### Saving Throw Checks\r\nIf you use the Saving Throw Checks variant, you would instead allow effects to critically succeed if they would critically hit, and critically fail if they would critically miss, as appropriate.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Crueler Criticals","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nNormally, when you score a critical hit, you roll the damage dice twice and add your modifier once. For instance, if you are wielding a weapon that deals 1d8 kinetic damage and is governed by Strength, on a critical hit you deal 2d8 + your Strength modifier kinetic damage. Sometimes, poor rolls lead to you doing *less* damage on a critical hit than a normal hit. For instance, you might roll two 1's on your 2d8, which with your +3 Strength modifier is only 5 damage. This feels lackluster.\r\n\r\nWith this rule, instead of rolling the damage dice twice, you instead maximize the damage once and then roll the second die. So, using the above example, instead of rolling 2d8 and adding your Strength modifier, you instead roll 1d8, add 8 for the maximum die roll, and then add your Strength modifier.

Essentially, instead of the GM making attack rolls against the players' static AC, the players make defense rolls against the GM's static attack save DC. Implementing this is easy.\r\n\r\n### Calculating Defense Bonus (DB)\r\nArmor class is replaced with Defense Bonus. This bonus is calculated simply by players taking their AC and subtracting 10. If a player had an AC of 16, they would have a DB of +6.\r\n\r\n### Calculating Attack Save DC\r\nAttack bonuses you find on monster cards are similar converted to static values, called the attack save DC. To calculate this DC, simply take the listed attack bonus and add 12 to it. For instance, a B1 battle droid's blaster rifle attacks with a +4 modifier. Instead, that droid would have an attack save DC of 16.\r\n\r\n### Making the Roll\r\nInstead of the GM making attack rolls, players make defense rolls by rolling a d20 and adding their Defense Bonus. If the roll meets or exceeds the attack save DC, the player successfully defends. If a character fails the the defense roll, the attack hits.\r\n\r\nIf the attacker would normally have advantage on the attack roll, you instead apply disadvantage to the defense roll, and vice versa if the attacker would have disadvantage.\r\n\r\nIf the defense roll comes up a 1 on the d20, then the attack is a critical hit. If the attacker would normally score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, then the attack is a critical hit on a 1 or 2, and so forth for broader critical ranges.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a 20 on the defense roll would automatically be a successful dodge, regardless of the attack save DC.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Destiny","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nDDestiny plays a large role in the *Star Wars* universe. As a young boy, Anakin Skywalker is told that his destiny is to bring about balance to the Force. Padme's destiny is to give birth to the twins, Luke and Leia, so that they can fulfil their own destinies. Luke Skywalker learns that his destiny is to redeem his father, Darth Vader, so that balance to the Force is restored. Leia's destiny is to save the Rebellion from annihilation at the hands of the Empire and help forge the New Republic. The destiny mechanic helps players and GMs recognize that all heroes - and even major villains - have significant roles to play in the fate of the galaxy. Destiny rewards players for good roleplaying and gives GM new plot hooks to use when designing adventures.\r\n\r\nThe rules presented below are optional. A GM may decide to use Destiny Points or not; however, the decision to use them should be made before the campaign gets underway, so that each player can decide whether or not to embrace a destiny for their character from the outset.\r\n\r\n### Choosing a Destiny\r\nPlayers don't need to choose destinies for their heroes at the start of the campaign - or ever for that matter. Not every hero has a destiny that must be fulfilled before the end of the campaign, and even players who want their characters to have destinies need to give their characters - and the campaign - a chance to develop first. It may take several adventures before players understand where the campaign is going and what goals their heroes are likely to pursue.\r\n\r\nChoosing a destiny can be handled in one of two ways: either the player can select an appropriate destiny for their hero (based on what's happening in the campaign), or the GM can select a secret destiny for the hero. If the player chooses a destiny for their character, the GM should challenge the player to fulfil their destiny by presenting conflicting situations where the smartest and most beneficial decision might force the character to choose between doing what is best for their fellow heroes and taking steps towards their destiny. If the GM secretly chooses the hero's destiny, they must present challenges that let the character move closer to achieving their destiny, imparting benefits when the character is moving in the right direction and imposing penalties when the character does something that takes them far from the destined path. The GM-selected \"secret destiny\" forces the player to take their character through a period of self-discovery, as they learn which action leads them closer to - or farther from - their destiny. In essence, this mirrors Luke Skywalker's struggle at the end of *The Empire Strikes Back*, when he must choose between redeeming his father and falling prey to the corruption of the dark side.\r\n\r\nA character with a destiny gains short-term benefits whenever they make significant progress towards fulfilling it, while a character who pursues goals that move them further away from their destiny suffers short-term negative effects. Conversely, a character without a destiny has nothing to gain and nothing to lose. A character may even fulfill one destiny and take on another.\r\n\r\nThe GM and players should work together to determine a destiny's impact on a campaign. One or more destinies might form the driving force for an entire campaign, or the central focus of a short series of adventures. In one of these cases, the GM should present the characters with choices that regularly affect their destinies, giving them many opportunities to gain destiny bonuses and penalties. Destiny-based campaigns should culminate in a final adventure that allows characters to ultimately resolve their destinies, for better or for worse.\r\n\r\n### Destiny Points\r\nDestiny Points are a resource that a player can use to help fulfil whatever destiny has been set before their character. You either have a Destiny Point or you don't - you can't stockpile multiple Destiny Points for later use.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Bonus\r\nWhen a character accomplishes a goal or performs a task that clearly moves them closer to fulfilling their destiny (GM's determination), they gain a Destiny Point.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Penalty\r\nWhen a character does something that clearly moves them away from their destiny (GM's determination), they lose their Destiny Point if they currently have one. If not, the GM gains one Destiny Point to be used against them.\r\n\r\nIf the character makes steps towards their destiny once more, this GM Destiny Point should first be discarded instead of awarding the player with one.\r\n\r\n### Final Destiny\r\nWhen the moment or encounter of a character's final destiny is upon them (GM's determination) their Destiny Point is not expended upon use and may be used repeatedly. Examples of such a situation include Luke Skywalker at the Battle of Yavin, or Revan upon facing Darth Malak onboard the Star Forge.\r\n\r\n### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nWhen a character fulfils their destiny, they gain permanent benefits. Sometimes fulfilling a destiny has other effects as well; these are also covered here.\r\n\r\n### Spending Destiny Points\r\nSpending a Destiny Point does not take an action and grants one of the following benefits:\r\n* Gain advantage on an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.\r\n* Impose disadvantage on an enemy attack roll, saving throw, or ability check (even once the attack is resolved).\r\n* Act out of turn (thus changing your position in the initiative order).\r\n* Take damage that would otherwise harm another character within your reach.\r\n* Immediately gain 2 of a consumable class resource (rage, force points, tech points, superiority dice, or focus)\r\n\r\n### Sample Destinies\r\nThe following sample destinies should provide a starting point for any character wishing to take advantage of the destiny rules. Each destiny includes a brief description, with examples.\r\n\r\n### Champion\r\nYour destiny requires your to become leader of a large and/or significant group or organization and successfully lead it through an extremely threatening event. Characters who have this destiny might or might not know of the group they are destined to lead. They must attain this goal through a mixture of training, charisma, experience and political maneuvering. The GM might want to divide this into two destinies: attaining leadership and leading the group through troubled times.\r\n\r\nExamples of this destiny include Mon Mothma leading the Rebel Alliance, Darth Sidious gaining control of the Republic, Wedge Antilles leading Rogue Squadron, and Admiral Ackbar escaping Grand Moff Tarkin and eventually taking command of the Rebel Fleet.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nYou receive a permanent 2 increase to your Charisma score.\r\n\r\n> ##### Sample Champion Destiny: Recruiting\r\n> Your destiny is to convince an influential person or group to secretly aid or openly join the resistance effort on a planet or in a sector. The person or group must have considerable authority and resources, and thus be able to operate behind a thick wall of underlings and bureacracy. The group might be a far-reaching criminal organization that has agents, established rackets, transports, and cover facilities throughout a sector. It could be a corporation that could lend its financial and material support to a local rebellion. Perhaps the hero encourages an influential military, government, or corporate leader currently serving the Empire to defect and aid the resistance. Convincing this entity to change its allied or neutral stance towards the Empire requires the hero to undertake missions to earn that individual's trust.\r\n\r\n### Corruption\r\nYour destiny is to corrupt an individual, organization, or location. You may seek to turn a person to the dark side or indoctrinate a group of people in the ways of evil. Your destiny may also be to become corrupted yourself, either by another character, an organisation, or a series of life-changing events that unfold over time. The corruption should be a long-term goal requiring a great deal of time and effort.\r\n\r\nExamples of this destiny include the Emperor's corruption of Anakin Skywalker, a dark force-wielder transforming a Jedi shrine into a temple of evil, or an Imperial officer convincing an Alliance cell to betray the Rebellion.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a character's destiny may be to allow themselves to be corrupted by the dark side; their fall into darkness becomes the path to achieving this destiny.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nIncrease two ability scores of your choice by 1 each. In addition, if you are using the variant Dark Side Corruption rules, consult the Dark Side Corruption table.\r\n\r\n### Creation\r\nYour destiny requires you to create an object, machine, or other item of great power or significant use. You must use this item in support of another character's destiny, or in a future destiny of your own. Others might help create the actual item, so long as you lead and make a significant contribution to the effort. Pursuing this destiny might require you to seek out rare or restricted materials, expert advice, and adequate construction facilities or shops.\r\n\r\nExamples of this destiny include Grand Moff Tarkin and the construction of the Death Star, Raith Sienar and the TIE fighter, and Walex Blissex and the *Victory*-class Star Destroyers.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nOnce per short rest, you or any ally within line of sight can take two actions in a single round while performing an action using the created object.\r\n\r\n### Destruction\r\nYour destiny is to destroy a person or object, for good or evil. A Rebel agent's destiny might be to destroy a tyrannical Imperial Moff presiding over his home planet, while a darkside may be destined to destroy a powerful Jedi training site used to bolster the ranks of the Jedi order. The target of this destiny should be something very difficult to reach, either because it's heavily guarded or well hidden. Example of this destiny include Darth Vader's destruction of the Emperor, Lando Calrissian's destruction of the Death Star II, or A-wing pilot Arvel Crynyd's destruction of the *Executor*.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nIncrease one ability score of your choice by +2.\r\n\r\n### Discovery\r\nYour destiny is to discover a person, species, object, or location that was either previously lost or unknown to the civilized galaxy. This could be as simple as seeking out the remains of a long-dead hero, or as rare as finding a vergence in the Force. A scout's destiny might be to find a thus-far-uncharted world that helps solve a galactic crisis, while a scoundrel's destiny might be to chart a new route through th Deep Core, allowing the Rebel Alliance to sneak past the Empire's security web. The thing being discovered should be something that can only be found as the result of a long-term search or serendipitous events that only occure because the character long ago set down the path that would lead to that discovery.\r\n\r\nExamples of thise destiny include Qui-Gon Jinn's discovery of Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine or Kyle Katarn's discovery of the Valley of the Jedi.\r\n\r\n> ##### Sample Discovery Destiny:\r\n> ##### Base of Resistance\r\n> Your destiny requires you to establish a hidden base that provides a safe haven and support for resistance fighters in a specific region. You might need to locate a new world that could accommodate a secret base or find a concealed facility on a known world from which dissenters covertly operate agains the Empire. You might need to gather allies and create secret support networks to maintain the base, supply it with equipment and weapons, and provide transportation for resistance forces. The scope of this destiny varies; it might be enough to establish a secret gathering place and a supply depot to aid resistance fighters in a single city, or it might require the construction of a major base to support operations in an entire system or even a sector.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nYou gain a permanent +1 destiny bonus to saving throws.\r\n\r\n### Education\r\nYour destiny is to train or educate another being or group of beings in some way. In some cases, this could mean taking a young Padawan learner and molding them into an eventual Jedi Master, or it could mean training fresh-faced Rebel Alliance recruits and molding them into a crack team of SpecForce operatives. Characters with this destiny are not merely teachers providing mundane training. The education that this destiny demands must be of great importance to the galaxy, and should lay the groundwork for the beneficiaries of your tutelage to go on to fulfil destinies of their own. Only when the training is complete can this destiny be fulfilled, and the process should take months or years to complete.\r\n\r\nExamples of this destiny include Obi-Wan Kenobi's training of Anakin Skywalker, Yoda's training of Luke Skywalker, or Grand Admiral Thrawn's training of Captain Pellaeon.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nYou gain a permanent destiny bonus equal to your proficiency bonus on checks made with one class skill of your choice.\r\n\r\n### Liberation\r\nYour destiny is to liberate a group, population, or region from Imperial domination. The focus of this destiny can range from a persecuted group - a small alien enclave, a remote town, or an orbital installation - all the way to a city, a starport, or even an entire planet. For instance, a hero might endeavour to free a planet's governing legislature, which has been previously relocated to a well-guarded penal camp by a hard-line Imperial governor to silence its dissenting view. As another example, they could attempt to wrest control of a starship construction facility from the Empire by influencing the worker population to revolt, supplying arms and equipment, and leading them in a mutiny. Achieving this objective usually requires organizing resistance to Imperial forces that are persecuting the local populace, destroying key installations or assets, or deterring or eliminating personnel that are vital for the Empire to maintain its oppressive grip.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nYou gain a permanent +1 destiny bonus to saving throws.\r\n\r\n### Redemption\r\nYour destiny is to redeem a character that has been corrupted or otherwise turned to evil. Many Jedi seek to turn their fallen brethren away from the dark side. A Rebel agent might seek to turn his brother, an Imperial officer, away from the evil Empire, redeeming him back to the side of justice and freedom. The target of this destiny should be someone that has fallen from the light in some way, whether that means turning to the dark side of the Force or simply siding with evil over good. Turning someone away from their wicked ways is usually very difficult and requires far more than simple persuasion. Often a a character that fulfills this destiny does not survive it, and sometimes neither does their redeemed target. Aditionally, you may be your own target for this destiny, making your own redemption the means of fulfilling it.\r\n\r\nExamples of this destiny include Luke Skywalker turning Darth Vader away from the dark side and Revan's redemption of Bastila Shan on the Star Forge.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nYou receive a permanent 2 increase to your Wisdom score. In addition, the Corruption score of the redeemed character is reduced to 1 and they lose any dark side corruptions they have accrued.\r\n\r\n### Rescue\r\nYour destiny requires you to save a person from death or an object from destruction. Often characters with this destiny will not know which person or object they're meant to save, let alone when or how to do so. They simply must be in the right place at the right time. A hero might spend months travelling with his allies before fulfilling his destiny by saving one of their lives. Conversely, a Rebel agent might engage in years' worth of espionage on his home planet, only to find that his destiny is to save a local Imperial magistrate who betrays the Empire after having her life saved.\r\n\r\nExamples of this destiny include Han Solo saving Luke Skywalker's life at the Battle of Yavin and Wicket the Ewok rescuing Leia from the scout troopers on Endor.\r\n\r\n#### Destiny Fulfilled\r\nIncrease two ability score of your choice by 1 each.\r\n\r\n### Death and Destiny\r\nAchieving one's destiny may yield great benefits, but the path of destiny can be perilous. Many characters in the *Star Wars* saga perish attempting to fulfil their destinies. If a Force-sensitive character dies while fulfilling (or attempting to fulfil) their destiny, the GM may allow the dead character to manifest as a Force spirit. If a non-force-wielder perishes while pursuing or achieving his destiny, the GM may decide that the character's sacrifice or untimely death imparts some benefit upon his surviving allies.\r\n\r\n**Force Spirit.** A force-wielder who dies in the process of fulfilling his destiny may manifest as a Force spirit. For a light side force-wielder, this means transforming into a translucent blue spirit that can appear before his former allies. For a dark side force-wielder, this means becoming an evil dark side spirit that can linger on, continuing to spread the influence of the dark side.\r\n\r\nIf a Force sensitive character dies while fulfilling their destiny, that character may become a Force spirit, retaining their consciousness (and their Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores) but becoming completely incorporeal. The Force spirit can menifest at will and can vanish just as easily. It can also walk through walls and exist in the vacuum of space. Additionally, Force spirits can travel anywhere in the galaxy instantly with a mere thought. However, Force spirits have no substance and cannot interact physically with creatures or objects in the universe.\r\n\r\nWhen a hero dies and becomes a Force spirit, that Force spirit might serves as a guide, advising heroes in times of dire need and sharing valuable information or wisdom it held in life.\r\n\r\n**Noble Sacrifice.** Whenever a character willingly sacrifices himself for a noble cause, particularly while fulfilling his destiny he can bolster the resolve of his surviving comrades and allies. For example, when Arvel Crynyd crashed his A-wing into the bridge of the Executor, it was a turning point in the Battle of Endor. When a character dies fulfilling his destiny in such a way, all allies within the same star system gain one destiny point.\r\n\r\n**Vengeance.** When a valued ally falls in the pursuit of his destiny, it can have powerful effects on those present at the time of his death. When a character dies fulfilling his destiny, any ally who witnesses his death may choose to become filled with a desire to avenge their fallen comrade, gaining a destiny point. Since revenge leads to the dark side, any force-wielder who chooses to gain this bonus must immediately increase his Corruption score by 1.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Dismemberment","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nSSome characters�and their players�take great pleasure in using their weapons to potentially maim their foes. If you want to add an additional layer to combat, consider using this variant rule.\r\n\r\nWhen a character scores a critical hit with a weapon that is capable of removing a limb, such as a lightweapon or vibroweapon, have them roll an additional d20. If they roll a 20 on the second d20 roll, they successfully remove a limb from a creature, or potentially slay the creature outright.\r\n\r\nThe character should then roll percentile dice and consult the Dismemberment table below.\r\n\r\n##### Dismemberment\r\n\r\n|d100|Result|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|01-40|You remove a hand.

As it stands, not account for advantage/disadvantage, you have a 1/400 (or .25%) chance to trigger a dismemberment when you make an attack roll. This increases to 39/8,000 with advantage (or .4875%), almost doubling the potential. You can increase it even more by changing the initial trigger to any critical hit, instead of just a natural 20, or increasing the range on the additional d20 from beyond just a natural 20, or both.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Dueling","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nDueling, be it with lightsabers or blasters, is an iconic experience in the Star Wars narrative. When you want to engage in a more narrative form of dueling, rather than traditional combat, consider the following rules.\r\n\r\n### Opponents\r\nMost often, dueling is an event suited only to two people. It might be a fight to the death, a fight for honor, or simply a fight to see who is better. Alternatively, it might simply be a sparring session. These rules are intended to potentially encompass all of these possibilities, but only for a traditional one versus one encounter.\r\n\r\n### Actions\r\nThere are three major actions a dueling character can take: Attack, Defend, or Feint. During each round of dueling, each involved party must decide which of these three actions they will take.\r\n\r\n#### Attack\r\nThe most common action, a character can choose to attack. When a character chooses to attack, they have advantage on the attack roll during resolution if the opponent takes the Feint action, and disadvantage on the roll if the character takes the Defend action.\r\n\r\n#### Defend\r\nThe second action a character can take is is to defend. When a character chooses to defend, they have advantage on the attack roll during resolution if the opponent takes the Attack action, and disadvantage on the roll if the character takes the Feint action.\r\n\r\n#### Feint\r\nThe third action a character can take is to feint. When a character chooses to feint, they have advantage on the attack roll during resolution if the opponent takes the Defend action, and disadvantage if the character takes the Attack action.\r\n\r\n> #### Extra Attack\r\n> If one party has the Extra Attack feature, and the other party doesn't, consider allowing them to roll with an additional instance of advantage.\r\n\r\n### Resolution\r\nOnce each party has chosen their action, they should each make an attack roll, with advantage or disadvantage as appropriate. The winner of the contest strikes a blow or scores a point, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n#### Ties\r\nGenerally, ties should either award a point to both parties�or no points to either party�at the discretion of the GM.\r\n\r\n### Strikes\r\nHow many strikes a character can take varies based on the lethality of the contest. You might grant each party a potential three strikes if sparring, or you might give them each strikes equal to their Constitution modifier in a lethal contest, or even strikes equal to their proficiency bonus in a fight for honor.

This variant rule offers mechanical boons to encourage utilizing elevation as a tactical device. Elevation grants a bonus called dominance, which comes in three levels.\r\n\r\nA creature has **dominance** over another creature if it is at least 10 feet above that creature vertically, and at least 10 feet away from that creature horizontally. While a creature has dominance over another, it has a +2 bonus to ranged attack rolls against the dominated creature, and the dominated creature suffers a -2 penalty to Dexterity saving throws against effects the creature dominating it controls. Additionally, a creature with dominance has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws against a creature it is dominating.\r\n\r\nA creature has **superdominance** over another creature if it is at least 20 feet above that creature vertically, and at least 20 feet away from that creature horizontally. While a creature has superdominance over another, it has a +3 bonus to ranged attack rolls against the superdominated creature, and the superdominated creature suffers a -3 penalty to Dexterity saving throws against effects the creature dominating it controls. Additionally, a creature with superdominance has a +3 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws against a creature it is dominating.\r\n\r\nA creature has **hyperdominance** over another creature if it is at least 30 feet above that creature vertically, and at least 30 feet away from that creature horizontally. While a creature has hyperdominance over another, it has a +5 bonus to ranged attack rolls against the hyperdominated creature, and the hyperdominated creature suffers a -5 penalty to Dexterity saving throws against effects the creature dominating it controls. Additionally, a creature with hyperdominance has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws against a creature it is dominating.\r\n\r\nA creature can only benefit from one level of dominance at a time for each creature it would be dominating, but it can have different levels of dominance for different creatures. For instance, if a creature is 30 feet above another creature both vertically and horizontally, it is hyperdominating that creature. If it is 20 feet above another creature vertically and 15 feet horizontally, it is only dominating the third creature instead of superdominating, since both values exceed 10 feet, but not 20.\r\n\r\n### Advantage and Disadvantage\r\nIf a creature has advantage, it can choose to forgo that advantage when making an attack to increase its domination level by one against its target until the end of its turn. For instance, if a creature has advantage and is 20 feet above another creature both vertically and horizontally, it is superdominating that creature. The creature can choose to forgo its advantage to instead hyperdominate the creature until the end of its turn.\r\n\r\nIf a creature is suffering from disadvantage, it can't dominate another creature regardless of how far away from that creature it is, horizontally or vertically.\r\n\r\n### Cover\r\nIf a creature would be dominating another creature, and it also has cover from that creature, the bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws don't stack. Instead, the dominating creature gains the higher of the two bonuses. For instance, if a creature is dominating another creature, and it also has half cover from that creature, it only gains the +3 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws against that creature. However, if the dominated creature has a feature that allows it to ignore the benefit of cover, such as Sharpshooter Mastery, the dominating creature would still gain the +2 benefit from dominating the other creature.\r\n\r\nConversely, if a creature is both dominated by another creature, and it has cover from that creature, you don't add the bonus and penalty together. Instead, you reduce a creatures dominance by one for each level of cover it has. For instance, if a creature is superdominated by a creature, but it also has one-quarter cover from that creature, it is instead just dominated. If the creature that is dominating it has a feature that allows it to ignore the benefit of cover, such as a Sharpshooter Mastery, however, the creature is still superdominated since the creature dominating it isn't affected by the cover.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Exertion","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nWhen the outlook of a situation is grim, player's might want to have their character attempt to go above and beyond, fueling their endeavors with their own vitality at the expense of potentially overexerting themselves through use of this variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Exert\r\nOnce per round, a player can have their character attempt to exert themselves. When the character makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, the character can roll a Hit Die without expending it, adding the result of the die to the roll. Alternatively, on their turn, the character can roll a Hit Die without expending it, increasing their speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of their turn.

As force-wielding characters evolve throughout the game, they can gravitate towards one side or the other (or neither, should they choose), resulting in physical manifestations and boons.\r\n\r\n### Alignment Score\r\nHow much a character embodies an aspect of the Force is calculated using their Alignment Score. The Alignment Score is an ever-shifting value falling between Light 100 to Dark 100. Characters gain an Alignment Score by gaining Light/Dark Points, as determined by their actions.\r\n\r\n### Gaining Light/Dark Points\r\nWhen a character performs an act associated with one side of the Force, they gain points accordingly. Players can gain Light Points through a multitude of actions:\r\n- The first time you cast a light side force power of 1st-level or higher, you gain Light Points equal to the power's level. Subsequent castings of that power earn you 1 Light Point.\r\n- Committing selfless acts, such as deliberately saving others at the expense of yourself, can earn you 1 or more Light Points.\r\n- Other benevolent acts, as determined by your GM, can earn you 1 or more Light Points.\r\n\r\nConsequently, players can also gain Dark Points through various actions:\r\n- The first time you cast a dark side force power of 1st-level or higher you gain Dark Points equal to the power's level. Subsequent castings of that power earn you 1 Dark Point.\r\n- Committing truly heinous acts, such as harming or murdering an innocent, can earn you 1 or more Dark Points.\r\n- Other evil acts, as determined by your GM, can earn you 1 or more Dark Points.\r\n\r\nIf a character has a score and performs an opposing act, instead of gaining points towards the other aspect of the Force, they lose them from their current score. For instance, if a player has 5 Light Points, and casts a dark side power of 4th level, they would have their Light Points reduced to 1. If the player instead casts a dark side power of 7th level, their score would shift to Dark 2.\r\n\r\n### Alignment Tiers\r\nAs you earn Light/Dark Points, you reach certain tiers of Alignment Score that manifest themselves in varying ways. If you ever fall below the Light/Dark Points threshold for a Major tier, you immediately lose that tier's benefits. You regain the benefits when you meet the criteria again. Minor tier effects are permanent unless another similar effect occurs.\r\n\r\n#### Force Alignment\r\n| Alignment Score | Features |\r\n|:---:|:---|\r\n|100|Luminous Being (Major Benevolence Tier V)|\r\n| 90|Minor Benevolence (Tier V)|\r\n| 80|Major Benevolence (Tier IV)|\r\n| 70|Minor Benevolence (Tier IV)|\r\n| 60|Major Benevolence (Tier III)|\r\n| 50|Minor Benevolence (Tier III)|\r\n| 40|Major Benevolence (Tier II)|\r\n| 30|Minor Benevolence (Tier II)|\r\n| 20|Major Benevolence (Tier I)|\r\n| 10|Minor Benevolence (Tier I)|\r\n|  0|Balanced|\r\n| 10|Minor Corruption (Tier I)|\r\n| 20|Major Corruption (Tier I)|\r\n| 30|Minor Corruption (Tier II)|\r\n| 40|Major Corruption (Tier II)|\r\n| 50|Minor Corruption (Tier III)|\r\n| 60|Major Corruption (Tier III)|\r\n| 70|Minor Corruption (Tier IV)|\r\n| 80|Major Corruption (Tier IV)|\r\n| 90|Minor Corruption (Tier V)|\r\n|100|Dark Entity (Major Corruption Tier V)|\r\n\r\n### Minor Benevolence/Corruption\r\nAt certain tiers of Light/Dark Points, you risk manifesting Minor Traits, as shown in the Force Alignment table. When you would earn a Minor Trait, you must first make a saving throw (Charisma for Benevolence, Wisdom for Corruption), the DC of which varies depending on the tier of the Minor Trait, as shown in the Minor Benevolence/Corruption Save DC table below. On a failed save, you must roll on a Minor Benevolence/Corruption tables, depending on the tier of the Minor Benevolence/Corruption.

In order to benefit from these features, bond-mates must be within 10 feet of eachother. This distance changes as their bond strengthens, as shown above in the Bond Distance and DC by Tier table.\r\n\r\nFor instance, at 1st tier, the bond-mates must be within 10 feet of each other to benefit from their bond's features. At 2nd tier, however, they must only be within 30 feet of each other.\r\n\r\n#### 1st Tier\r\nBoth bond-mates always know precisely where their bond-mate is in relation to them, regardless of whether or not they can see or hear them.\r\n\r\n#### 2nd Tier\r\nBoth bond-mates can speak with each other as if they were standing within 5 feet, provided they share a language. At 6th tier, this communication becomes telepathic.\r\n\r\n#### 3rd Tier \r\nBoth bond-mates are constantly under the effects of the *sense emotions* force power, but they are only able to read each other's emotions. This does not require concentration for either bond-mate, and this feature can not be interrupted while both bond-mates are conscious.\r\n\r\n#### 4th Tier\r\nAs an action on each of their turns, bond-mates can pass items to each other. When a bond-mate uses their action in such a way, the other bond-mate must use their reaction to take the item.\r\n\r\n#### 5th Tier\r\nWhenever a bond-mate makes an ability check or attack roll with advantage due to the other bond-mate taking the Help action, they can reroll one of the dice once.\r\n\r\n#### 6th Tier\r\nWhen a bond-mate casts a force power, they can cast it as if they are standing within 5 feet of their bond-mate. If the power requires a target, and that target is not their bond-mate, they must be aware of the target's presence and location in order to target them with this power.\r\n\r\n#### 7th Tier\r\nWhen a bond-mate casts a power of 1st-level or higher that targets only themself, they can also target their bond-mate. \r\n\r\n#### 8th Tier\r\nWhenever a bond-mate is reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, the other bond-mate can use their reaction to cause them to drop to 1 hit point instead. \r\n\r\nOnce this feature has been used, neither bond-mate can use it again until they both complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### 9th Tier\r\nOn their turn, one bond-mate can use their action to give their bond-mate an additional turn. If they do so, the targeted bond-mate immediately takes an additional turn after the current bond-mate's turn. \r\n\r\nOnce this feature has been used, neither bond-mate can use it again until they both complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### 10th Tier\r\nWhenever a bond-mate takes damage, the other bond-mate can use their reaction to grant them resistance to the damage. If they do so, both bond-mates take the same amount of damage. Alternatively, when a bond-mate has hit points restored, they can use their reaction to halve the amount of hit points. If they do so, the other bond-mate regains the same number of hit points. These features can be used a number of times equal to the bond-mate's combined Wisdom or Charisma modifiers (their choice, a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when both bond-mates complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Breaking a Bond\r\nSometimes, creatures might want to end their Force-bond, whether the bond was created unbeknownst to them or they no longer wish to share the bond. To do so, one of the creatures must spend 10 minutes meditating on the bond, and then make a Charisma saving throw. The DC of this saving throw varies, depending on the tier of the bond, as shown above in the Bond Distance and DC by Tier table. On a success, the bond's tier is reduced by 1. If the bond's tier is 1, it is broken. On a failure, the bond's tier is not reduced, and you can't try again for 24 hours.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Gestalt and Dichotomous Characters","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nBest suited for smaller parties, gestalt and dichotomous Characters are two separate variant rules that have some conceptual overlap. Gestalt focuses on a character having two classes simultaneously, while, dichotomous focuses on having one class, with two archetypes. If either�or Ashla forbid, both�of these concepts sound intriguing to you, consider the following variant rules.\r\n\r\n### Gestalt Characters\r\nAs indicated above, gestalt characters level in two classes simultaneously. They gain all of the proficiencies and features of each class, with following adjustments.\r\n\r\n#### Experience Gain\r\nBecause a character is leveling in two classes simultaneously, the amount of experience that character should require to gain a level should double. For instance, going from 2nd level to 3rd requires 600 experience points. For a gestalt character, it instead requires 1,200.\r\n\r\n#### Hit Points and Hit Dice\r\nIf a character chooses two classes with different sized Hit Dice, they should take the average of the two Hit Die sizes (rounded down), and they don't add the Hit Dice together. For instance, if a gestalt character chooses to level in consular, who has a d6 Hit Die, and guardian, who has a d10 Hit Die, that character would have a d8 Hit Die. If the player chooses consular and sentinel, who has a d8 Hit Die, however, their Hit Die would be a d6, since that would be the average of the two Hit Die sizes rounded down.\r\n\r\n#### Starting Proficiencies and Equipment\r\nFor starting proficiencies and equipment, what you receive varies:\r\n\r\n***Saving Throws.*** You choose the saving throw pair offered by either class. You cannot mix-and-match, and you do not get both.\r\n\r\n***Skills.*** You choose the skills offered by one of your classes. You cannot mix-and-match, and you do not get both.\r\n\r\n***Weapons, Armor, and Tools.*** You gain the weapons, armor, and tool proficiencies for both classes.\r\n\r\n***Starting Equipment.*** You gain the starting equipment�or starting wealth�for either class. You cannot mix-and-match, and you do not get both.\r\n\r\n#### Ability Score Increases\r\nWhen a gestalt character reaches 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, they gain the Ability Score Improvement feature in both classes. At each of these levels, that character should only gain this feature once, instead of twice. Alternatively, you can give them the full +2 Ability Score Improvement from one class, and a feat from the other, as with the ASI and a Feat variant rule.\r\n\r\n#### Force- and Tech-Casting\r\nIf a character chooses two classes that both have force- or tech-casting, they use the following adjustments:\r\n- They determine their Max Power Level as if they were multiclassing. If the potential Max Power Level of the two classes combined would exceed 9, however, they instead use the fullcasting Max Power Level progression present on the Multiclass Max Power Level table.\r\n- They add the force or tech points from both classes together.\r\n- They learn their powers separately by class, as with multiclassing, and those powers are restricted by that class's native Max Power Level regardless of their gestalt Max Power Level.\r\n\r\nIf a character chooses two classes with opposing casting, they ignore these rules. For instance, if a gestalt character levels as consular and scout, force- and tech-casting are treated separately as determined by their class.\r\n\r\n#### Overlapping Features\r\nIf two classes receive features that overlap, and aren't otherwise mentioned, it's up to the GM to determine how those features interact.\r\n\r\n#### Multiclassing\r\nGestalt Characters are not suitable for multiclassing.\r\n\r\n### Dichotomous Characters\r\nInstead of your character leveling in two classes simultaneously, you can have your character level in one class, but with two archetypes from that class.\r\n\r\nWhen a character reaches third level, they gain an archetype of their choice for their chosen class. Using this variant, they instead can choose two. At each level within that class that they would gain archetype features, they gain the features for both archetypes. If archetypes offer features that conflict, it's up to the GM to determine how those features interact.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can have a dichotomous character choose the features of only one archetype at a given level, rather than both, allowing the player to mix and match archetype features.\r\n\r\n#### Multiclassing\r\nIf a dichotomous character multiclasses, and reaches third level in two or more classes, it's up to the GM to determine whether they gain multiple archetypes in each class, or only in one.\r\n\r\n### Gestalt and Dichotomous\r\nGestalt and dichotomous characters, since they impact only certain parts of the character generation experience, work seamlessly together. Simply follow the rules associated with gestalt characters, including the restriction on multiclassing, and allow them to choose two archetypes in each class at 3rd level.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Hunted","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nIn some eras of Star Wars history, forcecasters are a rarity, and are hunted across the galaxy by the likes of Inquisitors, or if they're unlucky, a Dark Lord of the Sith, in an attempt to crush any foreseen threats to their rule.

This pool of Disturbance Points increases every time a force power is cast by a number of points equal to the level of the force power used (at-will powers are treated as Level 0). \r\n\r\nAfter each combat, roll a percentile dice for each player that used a force power.

Most (all?) of the class's invocation features are hard-locked; that is, once you choose it, you've got it for life. Benevolent GMs might allow players to replace a choice if they found it underwhelming, but others might not. With this variant rule, however, it is encouraged for GMs to allow their player's to rechoose invocations *on a case-by-case basis.*\r\n\r\n### What are Invocations?\r\nBeyond their choice of archetype, each class has a second level of customization collectively referred to as invocations. These invocations are as follows:\r\n- Berserkers have Berserker Instincts.\r\n- Consulars have Force-Empowered Casting.\r\n- Engineers have Modification Slots, which vary based on their class.\r\n- Fighters have their Combat Superiority Maneuvers.\r\n- Guardians have their Guardian Auras.\r\n- Monks have their Monastic Vows.\r\n- Operatives have their Operative Exploits.\r\n- Scholars have their Academic Superiority Maneuvers *and* Discoveries.\r\n- Scouts have their Scout Routines.\r\n- Sentinels have their Sentinel Ideals.\r\n\r\nOf the ten classes, only engineers (mostly), fighters, and scholars can re-choose their invocations, and even then only sparingly. Using this rule, you can instead let all ten classes re-choose their invocations, at appropriate intervals.\r\n\r\n### When Can They Re-choose?\r\nThe easiest route would be to allow characters to re-choose one of their invocation options when they complete a long rest, or even when they level up. Alternatively, you might enforce a narrative moment for them to re-choose. For instance, a guardian might not be able to relearn their Guardian Aura without spending some time with their master, while a monk might have to spend time in a monastery to re-choose a Monastic Vow, and a scout might have to spend time alone practicing to re-choose a Scout Routine. Ultimately, the method in which allow your players to re-choose their invocations is up to you and your playgroup. You might even let them re-choose on the fly.\r\n\r\n### Re-choosing Archetypes or Classes?\r\nRe-choosing archetypes or classes is not intended as a part of this variant rule. However, you could easily allow players to do so, though I'd recommend the narrative approach over the simple level up or long rest.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Longer Rests","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nSW5e offers greater character customization than traditional 5e, and ultimately yields more powerful characters.

Whenever a character spends a Hit Die to regain hit points, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.\r\n\r\n### Short Rest\r\nA short rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch, for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity�fighting, casting powers, at least 4 hours of walking, or similar adventuring activity�the characters must restart the rest to benefit from it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a short rest, a character regains missing hit points up to half their hit point maximum (rounded up). A character can then spend one or more Hit Dice, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level.

If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity�fighting, casting powers, at least 4 hours of walking, or similar adventuring activity�the characters must restart the rest to benefit from it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points.

Counterintuitively, when those species choose certain classes, those features become obsolete instead of enhancing their class choice.\r\n\r\nIf you players choose such a species/class combination, consider using this variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Armor Proficiencies\r\nMany species come with specific armor proficiencies suited to their species' culture, such as chiss or draethos, or natural unarmored defense, such as aing-tii or wookie. If a player chooses a species and class combination that would grant the same armor proficiencies, or a species with natural armor and a class with unarmored defense, consider instead granting them a bonus depending on the type of armor, as shown below:\r\n___\r\n- **Unarmored Defense:** +1 bonus to AC while not wearing armor or wielding a shield.\r\n- **Light Armor:** +1 bonus to Dexterity saving throws while wearing light armor.\r\n- **Medium Armor:** +1 bonus to Constitution saving throws while wearing medium armor.\r\n- **Heavy Armor:** -1 damage taken from weapons while wearing heavy armor. If this would reduce the damage to 0, the damage is instead reduced to 1.\r\n\r\nFor instance, at 1st level, a draethos operative with a 16 in Dexterity would have +6 to Dexterity saving throws instead of +5 while wearing light armor, while a wookiee berserker with a 14 in Dexterity and a 16 in Constitution would have an Armor Class of 16 while unarmored, instead of 15. A character should only gain each bonus once.\r\n\r\n### Weapon Proficiencies\r\nMany species come with specific weapon proficiencies suited to their species' culture, such as chiss or tuskens. If a player chooses a species and class combination that would grant the same weapon proficiencies, consider instead granting them a +1 bonus to damage rolls with the chosen weapon. For instance, at 1st level, a chiss scout with a 16 in Dexterity would have a +4 to damage rolls instead of a +3 when attacking with a blaster pistol or sniper rifle. A character should only gain this bonus once, and this bonus does not apply if the species offers a choice of weapons, such as human or echani.\r\n\r\n### Unarmed Strikes/Natural Weapons\r\nMany species come with higher unarmed strike damage, such as twi'lek or zabrak, or a natural weapon, such as chevin or karkarodons, representing their natural aptitude with unarmed combat. If a player chooses a species, class, or customization option combination that would both grant an increased unarmed strike, consider instead granting them a +1 bonus to their unarmed strike damage. For instance, at 1st level, a zabrak monk with a 16 in Dexterity would do 1d4+4 instead of 1d4+3 with their unarmed strikes.

If the character knows both force and tech powers, those powers can only be replaced with another force or tech power, respectively. \r\n\r\nThe character immediately unlearns the power they are trying to replace, and then must make a force- or tech-casting ability check (using Wisdom or Charisma as appropriate, depending on force power alignment) with proficiency.

Instead of the GM making saving throws against the players' static save DCs, the players roll a saving throw check against the GM's defense save DC.\r\n\r\n### Calculating Saving Throw Check\r\nIf players have their save throw DCs calculated, simply subtract 8 from that value. If your consular's force save DC is 15, your saving throw check modifier is +7.\r\n\r\n### Calculating Defense Save DC\r\nMonster cards also include potential saving throws, which can easily be converted to a defense save DC.

You can't take a Fighting Mastery option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\r\n\r\n#### Brawling Mastery\r\nYou've mastered using your weight to your advantage, easily wrangling targets around. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Your improvised weapons use a d6 for damage and gain the versatile (2d4) property.\r\n- Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).\r\n- Your speed isn't halved by carrying a grappled creature who is the same size category as you or smaller. \r\n- Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or an improvised weapon, you can make an additional unarmed strike or improvised weapon attack against the same target without the aid of your proficiency bonus (no action required).\r\n\r\n#### Close Quarters Shooting Mastery\r\nYou've mastered getting up close and personal with blaster weapons, maintain both rate of fire and accuracy. While you are wielding a blaster weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- When you take the Attack action, you can choose to fire rapidly at the expense of accuracy. Your ranged weapon attacks are made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you use your bonus action to make an additional ranged weapon attack, also without your proficiency bonus.\r\n- Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover against targets within 30 feet of you.\r\n- Other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move to within 15 feet of you, and you can use blaster weapons when making opportunity attacks.\r\n\r\n#### Defense Mastery\r\nYou've mastered the art of defending yourself, treating your armor as a second skin. While you are wearing armor with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Critical hits made against you are treated as normal hits.\r\n- When a creature makes a melee attack against you and misses, you can use your reaction to attempt to shove that creature up to 10 feet directly away from you.\r\n\r\n#### Dueling Mastery\r\nYour mastery of fighting with a single melee weapon is unsurpassed; you make one weapon feel like many. While you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand with which you are proficient and no other weapons, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- When you take the Attack action, you can decide to attack with haste at the expense of accuracy. Your melee weapon attacks are made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you use your reaction to make an additional melee weapon attack, also without your proficiency bonus. \r\n- When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.\r\n\r\n#### Great Weapon Mastery\r\nYou've mastered putting the weight of a weapon to your advantage, letting its momentum empower your strikes. While you are wielding a melee weapon in two hands with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.\r\n- Before you make a melee attack with a weapon that you are wielding in two-hands with which you are proficient with, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you add double your proficiency bonus to the attack's damage.\r\n\r\n#### Sentinel Mastery\r\nYou've mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard; in tight spaces you are indomitable. While you are wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.\r\n- Creatures within 5 feet of you provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.\r\n\r\n#### Sharpshooting Mastery\r\nYou have mastered blaster weapons and can easily make shots that others find impossible. While you are wielding a blaster weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.\r\n- Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.\r\n- Before you make an attack with a blaster weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you add double your proficiency bonus to the attack's damage.\r\n\r\n#### Shielding Mastery\r\nYou've mastered using a shield to defend your allies as well as yourself, and you understand that shields are not just for protection but also for offense. While you are wielding a shield with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- If you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to try to shove a creature within 5 feet of you with your shield.\r\n- If you aren't incapacitated, you can add your shield's AC bonus to any Dexterity saving throw you make against a power or other harmful effect.\r\n\r\n#### Throwing Mastery\r\nYou've mastered the techniques of throwing weapons, readily blending the weapons with your movements. While you are wielding a weapon with the thrown property with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- You gain a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls you make with thrown weapons.\r\n- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls with thrown weapons.\r\n- When you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack with a thrown weapon, you have advantage on your next melee weapon attack against that creature before the end of your next turn.\r\n- You can use Two-Weapon Fighting even when the melee weapons you are wielding in one hand aren't light, if at least one of them has the thrown property.\r\n\r\n#### Two-Weapon Mastery\r\nYou've mastered fighting with two weapons, becoming a flurry of motion. While you are wielding separate weapons in each hand, or a weapon with the double property, with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- While wielding separate weapons in each hand, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\r\n- While wielding a double weapon, when you roll a 1 on a weapon damage die, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1.\r\n- You can engage in Two-Weapon Fighting even when the weapons you are wielding lack the light property.\r\n- You can draw or stow two weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.\r\n- When you engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If you do so, you can make an additional Two-Weapon Fighting attack, also without your proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Versatile Mastery\r\nYou've mastered the art of using weapons in different ways, altering your attack patterns mid-swing. While you are wielding a melee weapon with the versatile property with which you are proficient and no other weapons, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- When you are the target of a melee weapon attack, you can immediately use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the target without your proficiency bonus. On a hit, you impose disadvantage on the attack roll made against you.\r\n- If you miss an attack while wielding a weapon in two hands, you can immediately make an attack roll against the same target using one hand. You can only make this attack once per turn. If the two-handed attack was made with disadvantage or without your proficiency bonus, this attack is made the same way.\r\n- If you miss an attack while wielding a weapon in one hand, you can immediately attempt to shove that creature up to 5 feet directly away from you. You can only make this attempt once per turn. If the one-handed attack was made with disadvantage or without your proficiency bonus, this ability check is made the same way.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Starship Destiny","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nSSometimes a starship is more than just a means of transportation. Sometimes, it's part of a character's destiny. In fact, for some characters, it's the focal point of their destiny, which might otherwise be nothing more than to wander aimlessly from one jam to another. No matter how humble (or downright ramschackle) a starship might appear, if it's the destiny of a character to be linked with that ship, it can accomplish amazing things.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to link a starship (or, rarely, a planetary vehicle) to your destiny, that replaces the normal destiny mechanic. In essence, you don't have a destiny to accomplish any specific goal; instead, you're destined have the most important events in your life with a specific starship. This option is appropriate in campaigns with at least a moderate frequency of starship-scale encounters, but it's certainly not restricted to such campaigns. In fact, if a campaign centers exclusively around starship-scale action, this option might be too powerful as it allows access to Destiny Points in most encounters. Only the GM can decide if starship-linked destinies are appropriate for a given campaign.\r\n\r\nYou earn and spend Destiny Points with a starship-linked destiny using the same basic rules as with the normal destiny options. However, having your destiny linked to a starship causes the rules to work slightly differently.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Destiny Points are earned when you experience (and survive) key campaign events involving you and your starship.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if a starship is your destiny, it is never completely destroyed. Even if it is blown up in battle or confiscated by Hutts before being crushed and melted, some small part of it survives. Perhaps you find the hyperspace core the whole starship was built around, or its ruined hull is found drifting as debris after that battle. Your starship can cease to be functional as easily as anyone else's, but a recognizable part of it always survives for you to rebuild (or retrofit to a similar starship). It can be as time consuming and difficult as getting a new starship would be (if not more so), but the result still qualifies as your destiny-linked starship.\r\n\r\nFinally, the options you can exercise by using a Destiny Point are slightly different, as detailed below. The following are possible only when you are acting as a crew member (pilot, gunner, mechanic, operator or coordinator) on the starship linked to your destiny:\r\n\r\n- Cause an attack rolled against your starship to suffer disadvantage, or gain advantage on a saving throw against an attack on your starship, even once the attack is resolved. (Coordinator or pilot)\r\n- Gain advantage on any pilot check. (Pilot)\r\n- Allow your starship to act out of turn, thus changing your position in the initiative order. (Coordinator, operator, or pilot)\r\n- Gain advantage on an attack roll, or impose disadvantage on an enemy saving throw, against an attack from your ship's weapons. (Coordinator, gunner, or operator)\r\n- Repair your starship, restoring hit points by rolling a number of its hit die equal to or less than your level. (Mechanic)\r\n- Immediately restore your starship's shields to full. (Mechanic or operator)\r\n- Gain advantage on any skill check made to interact with the ship.\r\n- Immediately gain 2 tactical dice.\r\n\r\nIn general, a character with a starship-linked destiny can do what no one else can manage - unless they, too, are linked to its destiny. There's nothing to prevent multiple characters from being destiny-linked to the same starship. Such characters might share the ship, or might constantly be stealing, buying or gambling it back and forther between them.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Strenuous Combat","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nCombat is a stressful activity, both physically and mentally. If you want to add an additional layer to combat to help encourage your players to handle things in a more civilized manner, consider implementing this variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Concluding Combat\r\nAt the end of a combat encounter, you might consider having each surviving participant make a Constitution saving throw to avoid exhaustion. The DC for the saving throw is equal to 10 + the number of complete rounds that occurred during the encounter. On a failure, a creature suffers 1 level of exhaustion.\r\n\r\n### More Restful Rest\r\nExhaustion is a painful penalty to add to characters, especially if they end up encountering multiple levels of exhaustion over the course of a gaming day. When your players' characters complete a short rest with exhaustion from this variant, consider allowing them to spend a Hit Die at the end of that rest to remove one level of exhaustion. \r\n\r\nIf a character encounters multiple levels of exhaustion due to this variant, they can spend more Hit Dice to remove the additional levels, either during the same rest or separate ones. Each time they do so, however, the effect is cumulative for each additional level. Removing a second level of exhaustion would take two Hit Dice, while a third would take three, and so on. For instance, if a character completes a short rest with two levels of exhaustion from this variant, they could spend one Hit Die to remove one level of exhaustion, or three Hit Dice to remove both. Once a creature has completed a long rest, the number of Hit Dice to be spent to remove this exhaustion is reduced back to one.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Tactical Initiative","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nRather than each player character and creature acting on their own, two or more allied creatures can instead choose to act tactically and work together using this initiative variant rule.\r\n\r\n### Rolling Tactical Initiative\r\nWhen combat begins and initiative would be rolled, two or more allied creatures can choose to work as a unit, provided they can see or hear and understand each other. When they do so, they each roll initiative separately, adding any modifiers as appropriate. Once each individual party has rolled their initiative, the group then acts using the lowest result. Once a tactical group is formed, each character's initiative is set to the lowest result, even if the tactical group separates.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if three players want to use tactical initiative, and they roll a 17, an 11, and a 14, all three players will instead act on initiative 11.\r\n\r\n#### Multiple Tactical Groups\r\nThe party can use multiple tactical groups rather than all working in concert. For instance, a party of five might split into a tactical group of three and a tactical group of two, each group rolling their tactical initiative separately. A character can only belong to one tactical group at a time.\r\n\r\n### Acting in Concert\r\nWhen a tactical group's turn comes up in the initiative order, each member of the group acts together. Their turns and actions can come in any order, though each individual tactical group member is still limited to what actions they could normally take. Additionally, actions that could normally be broken up, such as when a fighter takes the Attack action and has the Extra Attack feature, can be broken up during the turn.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a 5th-level fighter might take the Attack action and make their first attack. Before they make their second attack, however, the operative ally in their tactical group might then take the Help action to grant them advantage before the fighter makes the second attack.\r\n\r\n### Separating a Tactical Group\r\nWhen a tactical group loses contact with each other, or if the tactical group chooses to break up on their turn (no action required), the tactical group becomes separated. When separated, each member of the former tactical group acts on their own, though they retain the initiative of the tactical group. The order of any active members of the former tactical group acting on the same initiative is determined randomly.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Weapon Sundering","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nYYou can attempt to damage, and potentially destroy, a weapon held by a hostile creature. On your turn, you can take the Sundering action to damage an enemy's weapon. Make a melee weapon attack roll with disadvantage against the target's Armor Class as normal. If the attack hits, roll weapon damage and instead apply the damage to one weapon being wielded by your target.\r\n\r\n### Weapon Hit Dice and Hit Points\r\nA weapon's hit points are presented both as Hit Dice and hit points. A weapon has a number of Hit Dice equal to twice its damage dice. For instance, a blaster rifle has a 1d8 damage die, so it has 2 Hit Dice, which are d8s. A weapon's hit points are determined by taking the average of its hit dice. For instance, a blaster has 2 Hit Dice, which are d8s, so it has 9 hit points on average, as shown in the Hit Dice Average table below.\r\n\r\n#### Hit Dice Average\r\n|Hit Die|Average Hit Points per Hit Die|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|d4|2.5|\r\n|d6|3.5|\r\n|d8|4.5|\r\n|d10|5.5|\r\n|d12|6.5|\r\n\r\nAt the GM's discretion, some weapons might be resistant, immune, or even vulnerable to certain types of damage. Enhanced weapons are resistance, or even immune, to damage from unenhanced weapons.\r\n\r\n### Repairing Damaged/Broken Weapons\r\nA weapon is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points. As long as a weapon has 1 or more hit points remaining, a character can attempt to perform minor repairs by spending one or more of the weapon's Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the weapon's maximum number of Hit Dice. To restore hit dice, the player must first make an Intelligence (Technology) check\r\nIf a weapon has at least 1 HP remaining, you can attempt to make minor repairs to it during a Short Rest. To attempt to restore HD, a character must make an Intelligence (Technology) roll. The DC is 8 + the amount of damage the weapon has taken. The player has advantage on the roll if they know the *mending* tech power or are proficient with the appropriate artisan's tools (armstech's tools for blasters and vibroweapons, artificer's tools for lightweapons). On a failure, the Hit Die is expended and no hit points are restored. On a success, the player can spend the weapon's Hit Dice to restore hit points. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.\r\n\r\nA weapon regains Hit Dice when serviced by a professional with the appropriate artisan's tools, who can repair the weapon over a number of hours equal to the size of the weapon's damage dice. For instance, a blaster rifle has a 1d8 damage die, so it would take 8 hours to repair. This service costs half the value of the weapon.\r\n\r\n> In reality, lightweapons are probably more effective than vibroweapons when it comes to sundering weapons. For the sake of balance, they aren't. At the GM's discretion, weapons might be resistant to kinetic damage, or vulnerable to energy damage, to represent this effectiveness.\r\n\r\nA player can choose to specialize their character with the following features.\r\n\r\n### Fighting Style\r\nCertain class features or feats offer your choice of Fighting Style. As a part of this variant rule, you should allow your players to take the following Fighting Style instead of the options listed in the Player Handbook. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\r\n\r\n#### Sunder Fighting\r\nYou are skilled at striking in order to damage, and potentially destroy, your enemies' weapons. While you are wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- You no longer have disadvantage on Sundering attack rolls.\r\n- When a foe hits you with a Sundering attack, you can use your reaction to add a +5 to your armor class vs the triggering attack. If this causes the attack to miss, your weapon does not take any damage.\r\n\r\n### Fighting Mastery\r\nA feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise. As a part of this variant rule, you should allow your players to take the following feat instead of the options listed in the Player Handbook.\r\n\r\n#### Sundering Mastery\r\nYou have mastered rending your foes' weapons, leaving them impotent and vulnerable to your follow up attacks. While you are wielding a melee weapon with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Before you make a Sundering attack with weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you add double your proficiency bonus to the attack's damage.\r\n- On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a Sundering attack or reduce a weapon to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Wounds","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"\r\nWhen a character is reduced to 0 hit points, begins making death saving throws, and has hit points restored, they can return to the battle no worse for the wear. Using this variant rule, you can add an additional layer to make falling to 0 hit points more threatening.\r\n\r\n### Gaining Wounds\r\nWhen a character is reduced to 0 hit points, that character must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a success, nothing happens, but the DC of this saving throw for that character increases by 5, cumulatively, until they complete a short or long rest or fail the saving throw, at which point the DC resets to 10. On a failed save, the character suffers 1 wounded level. On a success or a failure, a creature immediately gains one death saving throw failure for each wounded level it has. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if a character with no wounded levels is reduced to 0 hit points and fails their Constitution saving throw, they gain 1 wounded level, and they then gain 1 death saving throw failure for their 1 wounded level. Alternatively, if a character with 2 wounded levels is reduced to 0 hit points and succeeds on their Constitution saving throw, they don't gain a wounded level, but they then gain 2 death saving throw failures for their 2 wounded levels. If they take damage, or fail the death saving throw they make at the start of their next turn, they immediately die.\r\n\r\n### Clearing Wounds\r\nA character loses all wounded levels when they are restored to their hit point maximum, whether through consumables, powers, resting, or other means.","contentTypeEnum":2,"contentType":"ExpandedContent","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":null,"rowKey":null,"timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null}]
