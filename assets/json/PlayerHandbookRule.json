[{"chapterName":"Adventuring","chapterNumber":8,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 8: Adventuring\r\n\r\nDelving into an ancient Sith tomb, slipping through the Black Sun territory of Coruscant, hacking a fresh trail through the thick jungles on the forest moon of Endor�these are the things that *Star Wars* adventures are made of. Your character in the game might explore forgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a new adventure.\r\n\r\nThis chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your character might pursue between adventures.\r\n\r\nWhether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon or the complex relationships of a noble court, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book's introduction:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**1. The GM describes the environment.**\r\n\r\n**2. The players describe what they want to do.**\r\n\r\n**3. The GM narrates the results of their actions.**\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nTypically, the GM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters' progress as they explore enclave corridors or wilderness regions.\r\n\r\nThe GM's notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers' actions determine what happens, so the GM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.\r\n\r\n## Time\r\nIn situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In an enclosed environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.\r\n\r\nIn a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours time.\r\n\r\nFor long journeys, a scale of days works best. Following the road from Tatooine to Kashyyk, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a pirate ambush interrupts their journey.\r\n\r\nIn combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described in chapter 9.\r\n\r\n## Movement\r\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a building corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope- all sorts of movement play a key role in D&D adventures.\r\n\r\nThe GM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: \"You travel through the forest and find the ruin entrance late in the evening of the third day.\" Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: \"After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient Jedi stronghold. you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.\r\n\r\n### Speed\r\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.\r\n\r\nThe following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\r\n\r\n#### Travel Pace\r\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the \"Activity While Traveling\" section later in this chapter for more information).\r\n\r\n***Forced March.*** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix A).\r\n\r\n***Mounts, Speeders, and Vehicles.*** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas. \r\n\r\nCharacters in shuttles, speeders, or other vehicles choose a pace as normal. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\r\n\r\n##### Travel Pace\r\n\r\n|Pace|Distance per Minute|Distance per Hour|Distance per Day|Effect|\r\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--|\r\n|Fast|\t400 feet|\t4 miles|\t30 miles|\t-5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores|\r\n|Normal|\t300 feet|\t3 miles|\t24 miles||\t \r\n|Slow|\t200 feet|\t2 miles|\t18 miles|\tAble to use stealth|\r\n\r\n### Difficult Terrain\r\nThe travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear enclosed corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground�all considered difficult terrain.\r\n\r\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain�moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed�so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\r\n\r\n### Special Types of Movement\r\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.\r\n\r\n#### Climbing, Swimming and Crawling\r\nWhile climbing, swimming, or crawling, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.\r\n\r\n#### Jumping\r\nYour Strength determines how far you can jump.\r\n\r\n***Long Jump.*** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.\r\n\r\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\r\n\r\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.\r\n\r\n***High Jump.*** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.\r\n\r\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1 1/2 times your height.\r\n\r\n### Activity While Traveling\r\nAs adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group's journey.\r\n\r\n#### Marching Order\r\nThe adventurers should establish a marching order.\r\n\r\nA marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.\r\n\r\nA character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.\r\n\r\n***Fewer Than Three Ranks.*** If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there's only one rank, it's considered a front rank.\r\n\r\n#### Stealth\r\nWhile traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move stealthily. As long as they're not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. See the rules for hiding in chapter 7.\r\n\r\n#### Noticing Threats\r\nUse the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine whether anyone in the group notices a hidden threat. The GM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the GM might decide that only those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the front and middle ranks cannot. While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a -5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to notice hidden threats.\r\n\r\n***Encountering Creatures.*** If the GM determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they're traveling, it's up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.\r\n\r\n***Surprising Foes.*** If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the GM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.\r\n\r\n#### Other Activities\r\nCharacters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don't contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats. However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or some other activity with the GM's permission.\r\n\r\n***Navigate.*** The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the GM calls for it. (The *Dungeon Master's Guide* has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)\r\n\r\n***Draw a Map.*** The character can draw a map that records the group's progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.\r\n\r\n***Track.*** A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the GM calls for it. (The *Dungeon Master's Guide* has rules for tracking.)\r\n\r\n***Forage.*** The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the GM calls for it. (The *Dungeon Master's Guide* has rules for foraging.)\r\n\r\n> ##### Splitting Up the Party\r\n> Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, especially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks.\r\n> The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier characters would alert. An operative and a monk moving at a slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their guardian friend behind.\r\n\r\n## The Environment\r\nBy its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places. The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules covering more unusual situations.\r\n\r\n### Falling\r\nA fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 kinetic damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.\r\n\r\n### Suffocating\r\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds). When a creature runs out of breath, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying.\r\n\r\n### High and Low Pressure Environs\r\nIf a creature is exposed a high or low pressure environ such as the vacuum of space or the deep ocean, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it immediately dies without making death saving throws.\r\n\r\n### Vision and Light\r\nThe most fundamental tasks of adventuring�noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a power, to name just a few�rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\r\n\r\nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\r\n\r\nA **heavily obscured** area-such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage-blocks vision entirely. A creature in or looking in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A).\r\n\r\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\r\n\r\n**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.\r\n\r\n**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.\r\n\r\n**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), or within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault.\r\n\r\n#### Blindsight\r\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as Miraluka, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as Togruta or Verpine, have this sense.\r\n\r\n#### Darkvision\r\nMany creatures in the worlds of Star Wars, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\r\n\r\n#### Truesight\r\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and enhanced darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by a power.\r\n\r\n### Food and Water\r\nCharacters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\r\n\r\n#### Food\r\nA character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food. A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.\r\n\r\n#### Water\r\nA character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.\r\n\r\n### Interacting with Objects\r\nA character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such a moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything happens. For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, open a door, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.\r\n\r\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons and powers. Objects are immune to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical attacks and powers much like creatures can. Generally, objects are immune to any conditions that are illogical, such as charmed or frightened. The GM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks. A character can also attempt a  \r\n\r\nStrength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.\r\n\r\n## Social Interaction\r\nExploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions that adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.\r\n\r\nInteraction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a Hutt so that he will spare your life. The GM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the interaction that don\"t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a **nonplayer character** (NPC).\r\n\r\nIn general terms, an NPC's attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It's easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.\r\n\r\nSocial interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.\r\n\r\n### Roleplaying\r\nRoleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it's *you* as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks.\r\n\r\nRoleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character's quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.\r\n\r\nThere are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.\r\n\r\n#### Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying\r\nWith this approach. you describe your character's words and actions to the GM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Chris plays Tordek the Nikto. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the Black Sun for his family's misfortune. At a bar, an obnoxious Twi'lek operative sits at Tordek's table and tries to strike up a conversation with the Nikto.\r\n\r\nChris says, \"Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the Twi'lek, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the operative before ordering another drink.\"\r\n\r\nIn this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek's mood and given the GM a clear idea of his characters attitude and actions.\r\n\r\nWhen using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:\r\n\r\n- Describe your character's emotions and attitude.\r\n- Focus on your character's intent and how others might perceive it.\r\n- Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.\r\n\r\nDon't worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing what you see in your mind.\r\n\r\n#### Active Approach to Roleplaying\r\nIf descriptive roleplaying tells your GM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying *shows* them.\r\n\r\nWhen you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character's voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character's movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things that can't be reasonably acted out.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here's how the scene might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:\r\n\r\nSpeaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, \"I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I'd snap your arm and enjoy your screams.\" In his normal voice. Chris then adds, \"I get up, glare at the Twi'lek, and head to the bar.\"\r\n\r\n#### Results of Roleplaying\r\nThe GM uses your character's actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn Jawa refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain Hutt laps up flattery.\r\n\r\nWhen interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the GM's portrayal ofthe NPC's mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to determine an NPC's personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence the NPC's attitude.\r\n\r\nInteractions in D&D are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCS something they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a senator's allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will fall short.\r\n\r\n### Ability Checks\r\nIn addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.\r\n\r\nYour roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC's attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your GM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play a role in determining an NPC's reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your GM's discretion.\r\n\r\nPay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a pavilion, the scoundrel who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion. When negotiating for a hostage's release, the force initiate with Persuasion should do most of the talking.\r\n\r\n## Resting\r\nHeroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their batteries and spirits for force- and tech-casting, and brace themselves for further adventure.\r\n\r\nAdventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.\r\n\r\n### Short Rest\r\nA short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\r\n\r\nA character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. Whenever a character spends a Hit Die to regain hit points, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. \r\n\r\n### Long Rest\r\nA long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch, for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity�fighting, casting powers, at least 1 hour of walking, or similar adventuring activity�the characters must restart the rest to benefit from it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them (minimum of one). \r\n\r\nA character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.\r\n\r\n#### Variant: Resting in Armor\r\nResting in armor makes it difficult to recover fully. At the end of a long rest, if you wore your armor, you only recover one-quarter your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one), instead of half.\r\n\r\n## Between Adventures\r\nBetween trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, gambling, or spending their hard-earned credits.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.\r\n\r\n### Lifestyle Expenses\r\nBetween adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in chapter 5.\r\n\r\nLiving a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.\r\n\r\n### Downtime Activities\r\nBetween adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\r\n\r\nDowntime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.\r\n\r\n#### Crafting\r\nYou can craft unenhanced objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. While you don't need to be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's implements), without proficiency you will lack the knowledge of what objects you can create. You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with armstech's implements needs a workstation in order to craft a vibrosword.\r\n\r\nFor every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 250 cr, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 250 cr, you make progress every day in 250-cr increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a heavy exoskeleton (market value 9,000 cr) takes 36 days to craft by yourself, at a total cost of 4,500 cr.\r\n\r\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 250 cr worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a heavy exoskeleton in 12 days, at a total cost of 4,500 cr.\r\n\r\nWhile crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle, as discussed in chapter 5, without having to pay 10 cr per day. If you have expertise in your chosen tool, you can instead maintain a comfortable lifestyle without having to pay 20 cr per day.\r\n\r\n#### Practicing a Profession\r\nYou can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 10 cr per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.\r\n\r\nIf you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a syndicate or guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.\r\n\r\nIf you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\r\n\r\n#### Recuperating\r\nYou can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.\r\n\r\nAfter three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:\r\n\r\n- End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points. \r\n- For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.\r\n\r\n#### Researching\r\nThe time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and ancient datacrons in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.\r\n\r\nWhen you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.\r\n\r\nFor each day of research, you must spend 10 cr to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).\r\n\r\n#### Training\r\nYou can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.\r\n\r\nFirst, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.\r\n\r\nThe training lasts for 250 days and costs 10 cr per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"8","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Appendix A: Conditions","chapterNumber":13,"contentMarkdown":"# Appendix A: Conditions\r\n\r\nConditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a power, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.\r\n\r\nA condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. \r\n\r\nIf multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.\r\n\r\nThe following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.\r\n\r\n#### Blinded\r\n- A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.\r\n- Unless a creature benefits from powers or a special sense, attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.\r\n\r\n#### Charmed\r\n- A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or enhanced effects.\r\n- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.\r\n\r\n#### Corroded\r\nSome abilities, effects, and hazards can lead to a special condition called corroded. Corroded is measured in three levels. An effect can give a creature one or more corroded levels, as specified in the effect's description.\r\n\r\nFor each corroded level a creature has, it takes 1 additional damage from weapons.\r\n\r\n#### Deafened\r\n- A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.\r\n\r\n#### Diseased\r\n- A diseased creature suffers effects that vary based on the disease.\r\n\r\n#### Exhaustion\r\nSome special abilities and environmental hazards, and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.\r\n\r\n##### Exhaustion Level\r\n|Level|Effect|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|Disadvantage on ability checks|\r\n|2|1 slowed level|\r\n|3|Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws|\r\n|4|Hit point maximum halved|\r\n|5|4 slowed levels|\r\n|6|Death|\r\n\r\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current exhaustion level increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.\r\n\r\nA creature suffers the effect of its current exhaustion level as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has 1 slowed level and has disadvantage on ability checks.\r\n\r\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\r\n\r\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\r\n\r\n#### Frightened\r\n- A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\r\n- The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\r\n\r\n#### Grappled\r\n- A grappled creature has its speed reduced to 0.\r\n- The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).\r\n- The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect.\r\n\r\n#### Ignited\r\n- A creature that is ignited suffers fire damage at the end of each of its turns. A damage value in parentheses appears with this condition—the fire damage the creature takes at the end of its turn.\r\n- If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames, the creature is no longer ignited.\r\n\r\n#### Incapacitated\r\n- An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.\r\n- An incapacitated creature automatically fails Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution checks.\r\n\r\n#### Invisible\r\n- An invisible creature is considered unseen to other creatures, without the aid of powers or a special sense that allow it to detect the creature, as described in \"Unseen Attackers and Targets\" in Chapter 9. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.\r\n- Unless a creature benefits from powers or a special sense that allow it to detect the creature, attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.\r\n\r\n#### Paralyzed\r\n- A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can't move or speak.\r\n- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as if it had rolled a 1 on the save. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\r\n- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.\r\n\r\n#### Petrified\r\n- A petrified creature is transformed, along with any object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.\r\n- The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.\r\n- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. \r\n- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as if it had rolled a 1 on the save.\r\n- The creature has resistance to all damage.\r\n- The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.\r\n\r\n#### Poisoned\r\n- A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\r\n\r\n#### Prone\r\n- A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. \r\n- The creature has disadvantage on melee attack rolls.\r\n- The creature has disadvantage on ranged attack rolls against targets within 30 feet.\r\n- An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.\r\n\r\n#### Restrained\r\n- A restrained creature has 4 slowed levels.\r\n- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.\r\n- The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.\r\n\r\n#### Shocked\r\n- A shocked creature can't take reactions.\r\n- On its turn, a shocked creature can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both.\r\n\r\n#### Slowed\r\nSome abilities, effects, and hazards can lead to a special condition called slowed. Slowed is measured in four levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of slowed, as specified in the effect's description.\r\n\r\n##### Slowed Level\r\n|Level|Effect|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|Speed reduced by 15 feet|\r\n|2|Speed reduced by 25 feet|\r\n|3|Speed reduced by 30 feet|\r\n|4|Speed reduced to 0, and can't benefit from any bonus to speed|\r\n\r\nIf an already slowed creature suffers another effect that causes it to be slowed, its current slowed level increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.\r\n\r\nAn effect that removes slowed reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all slowed effects ending if a creature's slowed level is reduced below 1.\r\n\r\n#### Stunned\r\n- A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can't move, and can speak only falteringly.\r\n- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as if it had rolled a 1 on the save.\r\n- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. \r\n\r\n#### Unconscious\r\n- An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings\r\n- The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.\r\n- The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as if it had rolled a 1 on the save.\r\n- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\r\n- Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.\r\n\r\n#### Weakened\r\n- A creature suffering from the weakened condition heals at a slower rate. When an effect restores hit points to the creature, the amount of hit points restored is halved.\r\n- Creatures suffering from this condition can only add half their ability modifier to ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws, unless that modifier would be negative.","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"13","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Appendix B: Recommended Variant Rules","chapterNumber":14,"contentMarkdown":"# Appendix B: Recommended Variant Rules\r\n\r\nHouse/variant rules are optional additions to GM each  game that in some way enhance or alter game play. Generally, they are done to alleviate stress from the GM, to improve player engagement, or to help a player realize a character goal. This appendix includes a number of variant rule options, all of which I offer at my table.\r\n\r\nI would encourage you to become familiar with the core content of this conversion before you decide if these house rules are right for you.\r\n\r\n## Defense Rolls\r\nOne of the first variant rules I added to my games was the Defense Rolls, published in the Unearthed Arcana: Variant Rules. Essentially, instead of the GM making attack rolls against the players' static AC, the players make defense rolls against the GM's static attack save DC. Implementing this is easy.\r\n\r\n### Calculating Defense Bonus (DB)\r\nArmor class is replaced with Defense Bonus. This bonus is calculated simply by players taking their AC and subtracting 10. If a player had an AC of 16, they would have a DB of +6.\r\n\r\n### Calculating Attack Save DC\r\nAttack bonuses you find on monster cards are similar converted to static values, called the attack save DC. To calculate this DC, simply take the listed attack bonus and add 12 to it. For instance, a B1 battle droid's blaster rifle attacks with a +4 modifier. Instead, that droid would have an attack save DC of 16.\r\n\r\n### Making the Roll\r\nInstead of the GM making attack rolls, players make defense rolls by rolling a d20 and adding their Defense Bonus. If the roll meets or exceeds the attack save DC, the player successfully defends. If a character fails the the defense roll, the attack hits.\r\n\r\nIf the attacker would normally have advantage on the attack roll, you instead apply disadvantage to the defense roll, and vice versa if the attacker would have disadvantage.\r\n\r\nIf the defense roll comes up a 1 on the d20, then the attack is a critical hit. If the attacker would normally score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, then the attack is a critical hit on a 1 or 2, and so forth for broader critical ranges.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a 20 on the defense roll would automatically be a successful dodge, regardless of the attack save DC.\r\n\r\n### Why I Recommend This Rule\r\nThis is the first variant rule I implemented at my table, and it has thus far been universally loved. Keeping players engaged is very important at the table. Additionally, abilities that players have that allow them to know your attack rolls are simpler since the player rolls the dice in the open.\r\n\r\nWhile I use this rule, and will continue to do so, when my players encounter \"boss\"-type mobs, I roll attack rolls as normal.\r\n\r\nI especially recommend this rule if you utilize the Space Combat optional rule set. Since the pilot on many larger ships doesn't operate the weapons, using this rule keeps them further engaged.\r\n\r\n## Saving Throw Checks\r\nAlso published in the Unearthed Arcana: Variant Rules was a rule for your players to roll when they use powers or abilities that call for a save DC. Instead of the GM making saving throws against the players' static save DCs, the players roll a saving throw check against the GM's defense save DC.\r\n\r\n### Calculating Saving Throw Check\r\nIf players have their save throw DCs calculated, simply subtract 8 from that value. If your consular's force save DC is 15, your saving throw check modifier is +7.\r\n\r\n### Calculating Defense Save DC\r\nMonster cards also include potential saving throws, which can easily be converted to a defense save DC. Take the appropriate ability score modifier and add 14 to it. If the monster is proficient in the saving throw (indicated in the *saving throw* line on the monster card, if it exists), instead use that value. For instance, if a B1 battle droid is forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, its defense save DC would be 16 (14+2).\r\n\r\n### Making the Roll\r\nInstead of the GM rolling saving throws for the monsters, players make saving throw checks by rolling a d20 and adding their saving throw check modifier. If the roll meets or exceeds the defense save DC, the creature fails the saving throw. If a character fails the the saving throw check, the creature successfully saves.\r\n\r\nIf the defender would normally have advantage on the saving roll, you instead apply disadvantage to the saving throw check, and vice versa if the defender would have disadvantage.\r\n\r\n### Why I Recommend This Rule\r\nFor all the same reasons as defense rolls. Players enjoy it, and it makes it easier for me to GM. Again, I don't use this rule when players encounter bosses.\r\n\r\n## Force and Tech Prowess\r\nWhen you fail an ability check, if you added your proficiency bonus to the check and you did not have advantage or disadvantage, you can spend 1 force or tech point to reroll the die. You can only use this feature once per ability check, and you must use the new roll.\r\n\r\n### Why I Recommend This Rule\r\nThis is actually a holdover from before casting ability modifier was added to force and tech points.\r\n\r\n## Simplified Forcecasting\r\nThe current version of the SW5e PHB has the player using different ability scores depending on the alignment of the powers they are trying to cast: Wisdom for light side, Charisma for dark side, player's choice for universal.\r\n\r\nFor new players, this might be too complicated. Consider letting them instead choose between using Wisdom and Charisma as their forcecasting ability.\r\n\r\n### Why I Recommend This Rule\r\nThis is a wonderful simplification for new players. I, personally, love the alignment determining the forcecasting ability, and I have relatively experienced players, so I haven't felt a need to use this.\r\n\r\n## ASI and a Feat\r\nThis one is simple. At level 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19, when a player gets the opportunity to choose between adding 2 to their ability scores or a feat, I'm letting them add 1 to an ability score *and* choose a feat.\r\n\r\nNow, this is going to create more powerful players, which means you need to pit them against more powerful monsters. I, personally, love this rule because I know it helps experienced players realize the exact character they want and helps to differentiate different characters of the same class. Then again, I'm a *huge* proponent of feats in general.\r\n\r\n### Why I Recommend This Rule\r\nI love feats and I love powerful player characters, so as a GM this rule works well for me. It's not for everyone.\r\n\r\n## Crueler Criticals\r\nNormally, when you score a critical hit, you roll the damage dice twice and add your modifier once. For instance, if you are wielding a weapon that deals 1d8 kinetic damage and is governed by Strength, on a critical hit you deal 2d8 + your Strength modifier kinetic damage. Sometimes, poor rolls lead to you doing less damage on a critical hit than a normal hit. For instance, you might roll two 1's on your 2d8, which with your +3 Strength modifier is only 5 damage. This feels lackluster.\r\n\r\nWith this rule, instead of rolling the damage dice twice, you instead maximize the damage once and then roll the second die. So, using the above example, instead of rolling 2d8 and adding your Strength modifier, you instead roll 1d8, add 8 for the maximum die roll, and then add your Strength modifier. This will make critical hits feel more impactful.\r\n\r\n### Why I Recommend This Rule\r\nAs indicated above, this variant rule helps make crits more impactful, but it's a double-edged sword, since it can make damage against player's spike, too.\r\n\r\n## Milestone Leveling\r\nI won't delve too far into this. The simplified version is that instead of receiving experience for every encounter and leveling up at odd times, the GM chooses when they level up. Additionally, there never has the potential to be an experience, and consequently level, disparity between players.\r\n\r\n### Why I Recommend This Rule\r\nMilestone leveling eliminates unnecessary record-keeping, helps maintain narrative significance to leveling up, and streamlines the GM controlling the game.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you utilize the Space Combat optional rule set, I urge you to use this. The nature of space combat is that there is no ship leveling up. Experience values relative to the amount required to level up will diminish drastically.\r\n\r\n## Bonus Action Consumables\r\nMost consumables require an action to use, which makes sense when applying them to others. However, a common adjustment in 5e (which is even more logical in SW5e), is to allow administering such consumables to yourself as a bonus action, instead. This only applies to consumables that confer a positive benefit, such as a repair kit or medpac.\r\n\r\n### Why I Recommend This Rule\r\nThis is a pretty common house rule at most tables, I believe. I've always used it since I discovered it years ago.\r\n\r\n## Hunted\r\nIn some eras of *Star Wars* history, forcecasters are a rarity, and are hunted across the galaxy by the likes of Inquisitors, or if they're unlucky, a Dark Lord of the Sith, in an attempt to crush any foreseen threats to their rule. Should you want your forcecasting players to experience this additional level of drama and suspense, here is an alternate rule to implement:\r\n\r\nWhenever a player casts a force power, others in the Galaxy may detect their presence through ripples in the Force. Each player has a pool of Disturbance Points. This pool of Disturbance Points increases every time a force power is cast by a number of points equal to the level of the force power used (at-will powers are treated as Level 0). \r\n\r\nAfter each combat, roll a percentile dice for each player that used a force power. If you roll a number equal to or lower than the players Disturbance Pool, they are detected by Jedi Hunters of your determination, who begin to hunt the player they detected.\r\n\r\nDuring each long rest, decrease each players pool of Disturbance Points by an amount equal to their level.\r\n\r\n### Why I Recommend This Rule\r\nI actually run a campaign in the Old Republic era, so I don't use this rule. It *is* great, however, for those who run in more restricted eras.","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"14","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Changelog","chapterNumber":99,"contentMarkdown":"# Changelog\r\n\r\n### 10/18/2022\r\n\r\n#### Throughout\r\n- The feature that replaced all minor rerolls with a flat 3 has been changed to scale by die, as discussed with a new chapter 7 rule called Minimum Roll Thresholds.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 3\r\n- Updated the introductory section of this chapter to explain how subclasses and invocations work.

Removed the caveat from those features.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 13\r\n- Total maneuvers in the PHB trimmed down to 100. Many maneuvers have been tweaked, moved to EC, or deprecated entirely.\r\n\r\n#### And, as always\r\n- Minor text fixes.\r\n\r\n### 04/19/2022\r\n\r\n#### Introduction\r\n- The blanket rule of Round Down has been replaced with Round Appropriately.

They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can't stand against. \r\n\r\nClass is the primary definition of what your character can do. It's more than a profession; it's your character's calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the galaxy. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A consular, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant of the Force. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the consular might know a number of Jedi or Sith who share his faith.\r\n\r\nYour class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter's mastery of weapons and armor, and an engineer's powers. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, as well as a detailed explanation of each one.\r\n\r\nAt 3rd level, each class gains an archetype, or subclass, that helps that class focus in a specific \r\n\r\ndirection or enable an entirely new playstyle, such as allowing raging in heavy armor for Juggernaut Approach berserkers or granting techcasting to Shield Specialist fighters. Each archetype grants additional features at higher levels, varying by class, as shown in the class table.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, each class has a second level of customization, such as a consular's Force-Empowered Casting or a scholar's Discoveries. The level at which each class obtains this second level varies. If a class's customization requires a level, that refers to class level. If a customization has prerequisites, the character must meet them to learn it. A character can learn a customization at the same time it meets the customization's prerequisites. Unless otherwise specified, a customization can only be taken once.\r\n\r\n> #### Multiclassing\r\n> Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. An operative might switch direction in life and become an engineer, or a berserker might discover latent Force-sensitivity and dabble in the guardian class while continuing to advance as a berserker. Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, appear in chapter 6.\r\n\r\nChoose from the following class options:","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"3","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Combat","chapterNumber":9,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 9: Combat\r\n\r\nThe shriek of blaster fire flying overhead. The *clash* of a gamorrean's axe striking against a composite shield. The crackle of lightning emenating from a Sith lord's hands. The sharp tang of blood in the air, cutting through the stench of vile monsters. Roars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in D&D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.\r\n\r\nThis chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or on a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules address you, the player or Game Master. The Game Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an adventurer. \"You\" can also mean the character or monster that you control.\r\n\r\n## The Order of Combat\r\nA typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and force- or tech-casting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A **round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn.** The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.\r\n\r\n### Surprise\r\nA band of adventurers sneaks up on a Mandalorian camp, springing from cover to attack them. Kath hounds patrol down a hallway, leashed to their handler, unnoticed by the adventurers until the hound smells one of them. In these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.\r\n\r\nThe GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter until the end of their first turn.\r\n\r\nIf you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.\r\n\r\n### Your Turn\r\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed�sometimes called your walking speed�is noted on your character sheet.\r\n\r\nThe most common actions you can take are described in the \"Actions in Combat\" section later in this chapter. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.\r\n\r\n> ##### Combat Step By Step\r\n> **1. Determine surprise.** The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.\r\n> **2. Establish positions.** The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are�how far away and in what direction.\r\n> **3. Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.\r\n> **4. Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.\r\n> **5. Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.\r\n\r\nThe \"Movement and Position\" section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.\r\n\r\nYou can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in \"Actions in Combat.\"\r\n\r\n#### Bonus Actions\r\nVarious class features, powers, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows an operative to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, power, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take. \r\n\r\nYou can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.\r\n\r\nYou choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.\r\n\r\n#### Object Interaction\r\nYou can also interact with one object or feature of the environment at any time on your turn, even during your move or your action, as your object interaction. For example, you could open a door as you stride toward a foe, you could stow your weapon as you run, or you could grasp a two-handed weapon you are wielding in one hand with your other hand as you attack with it (releasing it requires no action).\r\n\r\nIf you want to interact with an additional object, you need to use your action or bonus action (your choice). Some enhanced items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.\r\n\r\n#### Other Activity on Your Turn\r\nLastly, your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.\r\n\r\nYou can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.\r\n\r\n> ##### Interacting with Objects Around You\r\n> Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do with your object interaction:\r\n> - draw or stow a weapon\r\n> - open or close a door\r\n> - withdraw a stim from your pack\r\n> - pick up a dropped weapon\r\n> - take an item from a table\r\n> - remove a ring from your finger\r\n> - stuff some food into your mouth\r\n> - plant a banner in the ground\r\n> - fish a few chits from your belt pouch\r\n> - drink all the beer in a glass\r\n> - throw a lever or a switch\r\n> - pull a glowstick from a sconce\r\n> - take a book from a shelf you can reach\r\n> - extinguish a small flame\r\n> - don a mask\r\n> - pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head\r\n> - put your ear to a door\r\n> - turn a key in a lock\r\n> - hand an item to another character\r\n\r\n### Reactions\r\nCertain special abilities, powers, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction, typically an instant response to a trigger of some kind, can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.\r\n\r\nWhen you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction. \r\n\r\nCertain features, such as the scholar's Multitasker, might grant you an additional reaction. If you have two or more reactions, you can only take one per turn.\r\n\r\n## Movement and Position\r\nIn combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.\r\n\r\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.\r\n\r\nYour movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you're moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.\r\n\r\nThe \"Special Types of Movement\" section in Chapter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, and swimming.\r\n\r\n#### Actions That Grant Movement\r\nIf an action, bonus action, or reaction allows you to move as part of its effects, this additional movement does not count towards your speed. If it does not require an action, however, it does count towards your speed.  \r\n\r\n### Breaking Up Your Move\r\nYou can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.\r\n\r\n#### Moving Between Attacks\r\nIf you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter with the Extra Attack feature who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.\r\n\r\n#### Using Different Speeds\r\nIf you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a flying speed of 30 and a walking speed of 40 because a Jedi cast the *burst of speed* power on you, you could walk 20 feet, then fly 10 feet, and then land to walk 10 feet more.\r\n\r\n### Difficult Terrain\r\nCombat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases�the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.\r\n\r\nEvery foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.\r\n\r\nLow furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.\r\n\r\n### Being Prone\r\nCombatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.\r\n\r\nYou can **drop prone** without using any of your speed. **Standing up** takes more effort, costing an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.\r\n\r\nTo move while prone, you must **crawl** or use powers that teleport. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.\r\n\r\n### Moving Around Other Creatures\r\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is difficult terrain for you.\r\n\r\nWhether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.\r\n\r\nIf you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.\r\n\r\n### Flying Movement\r\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover.\r\n\r\n### Creature Size\r\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.\r\n\r\n##### Size Categories\r\n|Size|Space|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|Tiny|2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft.|\r\n|Small|5 by 5 ft.|\r\n|Medium|5 by 5 ft.|\r\n|Large|10 by 10 ft.|\r\n|Huge|15 by 15 ft.|\r\n|Gargantuan|20 by 20 ft. or larger|\r\n\r\n#### Space\r\nA creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium gamorrean stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the gamorrean lets them.\r\n\r\nA creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one. \r\n\r\nBecause larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\r\n\r\nIf a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.\r\n\r\n#### Squeezing into a Smaller Space\r\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.\r\n\r\n> #### Variant: Playing on a Grid\r\n> If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.\r\n> ***Squares.*** Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.\r\n> ***Speed.*** Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.\r\n> ***Entering a Square.*** To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, unless the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you're in (discussed below). \r\n> ***Corners.*** Diagonal movement can't cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.\r\n> ***Ranges.*** To determine the range on a grid between two things�whether creatures or objects�start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.\r\n> ***Diagonals.*** When measuring range or moving diagonally, the first diagonal square counts as 5 feet, but the second diagonal square counts as 10 feet. This pattern of 5 feet and then 10 feet continues whenever you're counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of diagonal movement. For instance, a character might move one square diagonally (5 feet), then three squares straight (15 feet), and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total movement of 30 feet.\r\n\r\n## Actions in Combat\r\nWhen you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many creatures have action options of their own in their stat blocks.\r\n\r\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\r\n\r\n### Attack\r\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a vibrosword, firing a blaster, or brawling with your fists. With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the \"Making an Attack\" section for the rules that govern attacks.\r\n\r\nCertain features, such as the Extra Attack class feature, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\r\n\r\n### Cast a Power\r\nForce- and tech-casters such as consulars and engineers, as well as many creatures, have access to powers and can use them to great effect in combat. Each power has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the power. Casting a power is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most powers do have a casting time of 1 action, so a force- or tech-caster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a power. See chapter 10 for the rules on force- and tech-casting.\r\n\r\n### Dash\r\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.\r\n\r\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you Dash.\r\n\r\n### Disengage\r\nIf you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.\r\n\r\n### Dodge\r\nWhen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.\r\n\r\n### Guard\r\nYou can defend an ally within 5 feet of you. When you take the Guard action, you focus entirely on preventing attacks from reaching your ally. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against the guarded ally has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, as long as the ally is within 5 feet of you. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if an attack would hit the guarded ally, you can instead have it hit you (no action required). If you do so, the attacker chooses the maximum amount of damage instead of rolling.\r\n\r\n### Help\r\nYou can lend your aid to an ally in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the ally you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can aid an ally in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.\r\n\r\n### Hide\r\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the \"Unseen Attackers and Targets\" section later in this chapter.\r\n\r\n> #### Improvising an Action\r\n> Your character can do things not covered by the actions in this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in defenses, or calling for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions you can attempt are your imagination and your character's ability scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores in chapter 7 for inspiration as you improvise.\r\n> When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\r\n\r\n### Ready\r\nSometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.\r\n\r\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include \"If the soldier steps on the trapdoor, I'll pull the lever that opens it,\" and \"If the gamorrean steps next to me, I move away.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.\r\n\r\nWhen you ready a power, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a power must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the power's effect requires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your concentration is broken, the power dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the *knight speed* power and ready *shock,* your *knight speed* power ends, and if you take damage before you release *shock* with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\r\n\r\n### Search\r\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\r\n\r\n### Use an Object\r\nMany objects and items, such as grenades or medpacs, require your action to use. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. If you would normally have to use your object interaction to draw the item you are using, you can instead do so as part of the Use an Object action. \r\n\r\n## Making an Attack\r\nWhether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a power, an attack has a simple structure.\r\n\r\n**1. Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.\r\n\r\n**2. Determine modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, powers, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.\r\n\r\n**3. Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage. If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.\r\n\r\n### Attack Rolls\r\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a creature is in its stat block.\r\n\r\n#### Modifiers to the Roll\r\nWhen a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a creature makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\r\n\r\n***Ability Modifier.*** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule. \r\n\r\nSome powers also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a power attack depends on the force- or tech-casting ability of the force- or tech-caster, as explained in chapter 10.\r\n\r\n***Proficiency Bonus.*** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a power.\r\n\r\n#### Rolling 1 or 20\r\nSometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss. \r\n\r\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. In addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained later in this chapter.\r\n\r\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.\r\n\r\n#### Choosing to be Hit\r\nSometimes, an attack might miss you when you wanted it to hit. You can choose to allow a miss to hit you (no action required). If you do so, the attacker chooses the maximum amount of damage instead of rolling.\r\n\r\n### Unseen Attackers and Targets\r\nCombatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the *force camouflage* power, or lurking in darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.\r\n\r\nWhen a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it.\r\n\r\nIf you are hidden�both unseen and unheard�when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.\r\n\r\n### Melee Attacks\r\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a vibrosword, a lightsaber, or a vibrowhip. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few powers also involve making a melee attack.\r\n\r\nMost creatures have a 5-foot **reach** and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether or not you are armed, you can fight in melee by making an unarmed strike. Your unarmed strikes are a weapon with which you are proficient and, unless otherwise indicated, they do 1 + your Strength modifier kinetic damage.\r\n\r\n#### Opportunity Attacks\r\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack. \r\n\r\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack interrupts the provoking creature's movement, occurring right before the creature leaves your reach.\r\n\r\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something unwillingly moves you without using your movement, action, bonus action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy. However, you do provoke an opportunity attack if a power such as *force jump*, or an ally's Formation fighting style feature, causes you to move out of an enemies' reach, unless that feature says otherwise.\r\n\r\n#### Grappling\r\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a **grapple**. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\r\n\r\n> #### Contests in Combat\r\n> Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.\r\n\r\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, which is occupied for the duration of the grapple, you try to seize the target by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\r\n\r\n***Escaping a Grapple.*** A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\r\n\r\n***Moving a Grappled Creature.*** When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\r\n\r\n#### Shoving and Tripping\r\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to **shove** a creature to push it away from you, or to **trip** a creature to knock it prone. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\r\n\r\nThe target of your shove or trip must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either shove the target 5 feet away from you or trip it prone.\r\n\r\n### Ranged Attacks\r\nWhen you make a ranged attack, you fire a blaster, hurl a vibrodagger, or otherwise strike a foe at a distance. A creature might have a natural ranged weapon. Many powers also involve making a ranged attack.\r\n\r\n#### Range\r\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as one made with a power, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range. Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a blaster, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range.\r\n\r\n#### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat\r\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a power, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't incapacitated.\r\n\r\n### Double-Weapon Fighting\r\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a weapon with the light and double properties that you're wielding in two hands, you can use a bonus action to attack with the other end of the weapon. You don't add your ability modifier to the attack roll of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.\r\n\r\n### Two-Weapon Fighting\r\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a weapon with the light property that you're wielding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light weapon that you're wielding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage roll of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.\r\n\r\nIf a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\r\n\r\n## Cover\r\nWalls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.\r\n\r\nThere are four degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies, not added together.\r\n\r\nA target with **one-quarter cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has one-quarter cover if an obstacle blocks at least one-fourth of its body, such as a thin pillar or a creature of one size category smaller.\r\n\r\nA target with **half cover** has a +3 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body, such as a low wall or a creature of the same size category.\r\n\r\nA target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarter cover if about three-quarters of it is obstructed, whether by an obstacle or a creature of one size category larger.\r\n\r\nA target with **total cover** can't be targeted directly by an attack or a power, although some powers can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.\r\n\r\n#### Variant: Creatures Providing Cover\r\nSometimes, creatures in close proximity create a veritable mess of bodies, potentially causing attacks targeting one to hit another. Using this variant, if an attack would miss a creature by an amount less than or equal to the bonus to AC granted by the cover of another creature, and the attack would hit that other creature, the GM might consider having that other creature take the attack's damage.\r\n\r\n## Damage and Healing\r\nInjury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore the worlds of D&D. The thrust of a vibrosword, a well-placed blaster shot, or a shock of lightning from a *shock* power all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.\r\n\r\n### Hit Points\r\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.\r\n\r\nA creature's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes as a creature takes damage or receives healing.\r\n\r\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature's capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.\r\n\r\n### Damage Rolls\r\nEach weapon, power, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Modified weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.\r\n\r\nWhen attacking with a **weapon,** you add your ability modifier�the same modifier used for the attack roll�to the damage. A **power** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.\r\n\r\nIf a power or other effect deals damage to **more than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when an engineer casts *explosion*, the power's damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.\r\n\r\n#### Critical Hits\r\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll all of the attack's damage dice twice, including any additional damage dice, and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.\r\n\r\n***Critical Hit Range.*** The critical hit range of an effect determines on what d20 results that effect scores a critical hit. Typically, an effect has a critical hit range of 1, meaning it only scores a critical hit on a 20. A critical hit range of 2, however, would mean the effect scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. A critical hit range cannot exceed 5, scoring a critical hit on 16-20.\r\n\r\n#### Damage Types\r\nDifferent attacks, damaging powers, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.\r\n\r\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.\r\n\r\n***Acid.*** Vials of corrosive liquid or the *acid splash* tech power deal acid damage.\r\n\r\n***Cold.*** The chill energy of carbonite and cryogenesis deal cold damage.\r\n\r\n***Energy.*** Energy damage is the damage dealt by blaster weapons, lightweapons, and other powers or abilities.\r\n\r\n***Fire.*** The concussive damage of an explosion or an open flame deal fire damage.\r\n\r\n***Force.*** Certain force powers that channel the pure energy of the Force deal force damage. \r\n\r\n***Ion.*** Ion damage is a special damage type that is most effective against droids and constructs. Simple electronics dealt ion damage are disabled until rebooted, unless that damage would destroy them outright. \r\n\r\n***Kinetic.*** Kinetic damage encompasses all physical damage commonly dealt by vibroweapons.\r\n\r\n***Lightning.*** The electrifying energy of the *force lightning* power deals lightning damage.\r\n\r\n***Necrotic.*** Necrotic damage, dealt by powers like *death field*, withers matter and even the soul.\r\n\r\n***Poison.*** Venomous stings and the toxic *poison spray* power deal poison damage.\r\n\r\n***Psychic.*** The crippling agony causes by powers like *feedback* deal psychic damage.\r\n\r\n***Sonic.*** Debilitating noises cause sonic damage.\r\n\r\n***True.*** True damage is not dealt by any specific source. Instead, effects that prevent or redirect damage cannot be used to counter the loss of life caused by true damage.\r\n\r\n### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability\r\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is reduced by half against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.\r\n\r\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to lightning damage as well as resistance to all force power damage, the damage of a *force lightning* is reduced by half, not reduced by three-quarters.\r\n\r\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after passive modifiers to damage, but before active modifiers. For example, a creature with resistance to kinetic damage, a proficiency bonus of +4, and the Defense fighting mastery is hit by an attack that deals 22 kinetic damage. The 22 damage is first reduced by 4 and then halved, so the creature takes 9 damage. The creature also has the Shield fighting mastery, and uses its reaction to further reduce the damage taken by 4, finally taking only 5 damage.\r\n\r\n> ##### Describing the Effects of Damage\r\n> Game Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. When your current hit point total is above half your hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. When you drop below half your hit point maximum, you show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving a bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply knocks you unconscious.\r\n\r\n### Healing\r\nUnless it results in death, damage isn't permanent. Rest can restore a creature's hit points (as explained in chapter 8), and methods such as a *benevolence* force power or a medpac can remove damage instantly.\r\n\r\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a consular grants an operative 8 hit points of healing. If the operative has 14 current hit points with a maximum of 20, the operative regains 6 hit points from the consular, not 8.\r\n\r\nA creature that has died can't regain hit points until a power such as *revitalize* has restored it to life.\r\n\r\n#### Hit Dice\r\nResting (explained in chapter 8), as well as certain special traits such as the trandoshan's Regenerative, consume Hit Dice to restore hit points. Whenever a creature rolls a Hit Die to restore hit points, they add their Constitution modifier to the roll.\r\n\r\n### Dropping to 0 Hit Points\r\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\r\n\r\n#### Instant Death\r\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\r\n\r\nFor example, a consular with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the consular dies.\r\n\r\n#### Falling Unconscious\r\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\r\n\r\n#### Death Saving Throws\r\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn't tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by powers and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw. Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\r\n\r\n***Rolling 1 or 20.*** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\r\n\r\n***Damage at 0 Hit Points.*** If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points (for example, by catching fire because your limbs were all chopped off next to a pit of lava), you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\r\n\r\n#### Stabilizing a Creature\r\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't killed by a failed death saving throw.\r\n\r\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check, or an Intelligence (Technology) check for a droid or construct.\r\n\r\nA **stable** creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\r\n\r\n#### Monsters and Death\r\nMost GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.\r\n\r\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\r\n\r\n### Knocking a Creature Out\r\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack, or blaster weapon that deals ion or energy damage, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\r\n\r\n## Temporary Hit Points\r\nSome powers and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\r\n\r\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\r\n\r\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\r\n\r\nHealing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a power grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\r\n\r\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you. \r\n\r\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n### Temporary Force and Tech Points\r\nSimilar to temporary hit points, some powers, abilities, or features grant temporary force or tech points to a creature. When you would expend force or tech points�whether through a power, ability, or feature�the temporary points are spent first.\r\n\r\nYou can only have one source of temporary force or tech points. If you have temporary force or tech points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or gain the new ones.\r\n\r\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary force or tech points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.\r\n\r\n## Underwater Combat\r\nWhen adventurers pursue karkarodons back to their undersea domain, fight off gungans in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.\r\n\r\nWhen making a **melee weapon attack,** a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by a power) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a vibrodagger or vibrospear.\t\r\n\r\nA **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range, but functions normally against a target within normal range.\r\n\r\nCreatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.\r\n\r\n## Mounted Combat\r\nA trooper charging into battle on a dewback, an engineer casting powers from the seat of a speeder, or a consular soaring through the sky on shuttle all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.\r\n\r\nAn appropriately sized vehicle or a willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.\r\n\r\n### Mounting and Dismounting\r\nOnce during your move, you can mount or dismount a vehicle or willing creature that is within 5 feet of you. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a dewback. Therefore, you can't mount it if you don't have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.\r\n\r\nIf an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.\r\n\r\nIf your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.\r\n\r\n#### Controlling a Mount\r\nWhile you're mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures act independently.\r\n\r\nYou can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated animals, such as dewbacks or kaadu, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it. All vehicles are considered controlled mounts, unless a feature says otherwise.\r\n\r\nAn independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\r\n\r\nIn either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"9","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Customization Options","chapterNumber":6,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 6: Customization Options\r\n\r\nThe combination of ability scores, species, class, and background defines your character's capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and species, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who�with the GM's permission�want to go a step further.\r\n\r\nThis chapter defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain levels. Your GM decides whether these options are available in a campaign.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this chapter covers three other customization options: fighting styles, fighting masteries, and lightsaber forms. All three options enable a new way to engage with weapons. Lightsaber forms are restricted to forcecasters.\r\n\r\n## Multiclassing\r\nMulticlassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.\r\n\r\nWith this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in consular and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.\r\n\r\nAs you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.\r\n\r\n> #### Multiclassing Example\r\n> Drew is playing a 4th-level fighter. When his character earns enough experience points to reach 5th level, Drew decides that his character will multiclass instead of continuing to progress as a fighter. Drew's fighter has been spending a lot of time with Rickey's scout, and has even been doing some jobs on the side for the Bounty Broker's Association as a bounty hunter. Drew decides that his character will multiclass into the operative class, and thus his character becomes a 4th-level fighter and 1st-level operative (written as fighter 4/operative 1).\r\n> When Drew's character earns enough experience to reach 6th level, he can decide whether to add another fighter level (becoming a fighter 5/operative 1), another operative level (becoming a fighter 4/operative 2), or a level in a third class, perhaps dabbling in the Force thanks to a Sith holocron he acquired (becoming a fighter 4/operative 1/consular 1).\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\nTo qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a berserker who decides to multiclass into the engineer class must have both Strength and Intelligence scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.\r\n\r\n##### Multiclassing Prerequisites\r\n|Class||Ability Score Minimum|\r\n|:--|:--:|:--|\r\n|Berserker||Strength 13|\r\n|Consular||Wisdom or Charisma 13|\r\n|Engineer||Intelligence 13|\r\n|Fighter||Strength or Dexterity 13|\r\n|Guardian||Constitution 13, Wisdom or Charisma 13|\r\n|Monk||Dexterity 13, Wisdom or Charisma 13|\r\n|Operative||Dexterity 13|\r\n|Scholar||Intelligence 13|\r\n|Scout||Strength or Dexterity 13, Intelligence 13|\r\n|Sentinel||Dexterity 13, Wisdom or Charisma 13|\r\n\r\n### Experience Points\r\nThe experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a consular 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a consular.\r\n\r\n### Hit Points and Hit Dice\r\nYou gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.\r\n\r\nYou add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the guardian have a d10, so if you are a fighter 5/guardian 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a fighter 5/operative 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.\r\n\r\n### Proficiency Bonus\r\nYour proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1. For example, if you are a fighter 3/operative 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-level character, which is +3.\r\n\r\nIf a feature or feat allows you to forgo your proficiency bonus, you may only do so once.\r\n\r\n### Proficiencies\r\nWhen you gain a level in a class other than your first, you gain only some of that class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.\r\n\r\n##### Multiclassing Proficiencies\r\n|Class||Proficiencies Gained|\r\n|:--|:--:|:--|\r\n|Berserker||Light armor, all vibroweapons||\r\n|Consular||Simple lightweapons|\r\n|Fighter||Light armor, medium armor, all blasters, all vibroweapons|\r\n|Engineer||Light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, one tool from the class's list|\r\n|Guardian||Light armor, medium armor, all lightweapons, all vibroweapons|\r\n|Operative||Light armor, any one skill, one tool from the class's list|\r\n|Monk||Techblades|\r\n|Scout||Light armor, medium armor, all blasters, all vibroweapons, one skill from the class's list|\r\n|Scholar||Light armor, one skill from the class's list|\r\n|Sentinel||Light armor, simple lightweapons, one skill from the class's list|\r\n\r\n## Class Features\r\nWhen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. Some features, however, have additional rules when you're multiclassing, as shown below.\r\n\r\n### Extra Attack\r\nIf you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do. \r\n\r\n### Superiority and Maneuvers\r\nIf you have levels in multiple classes that have superiority features:\r\n- **Maneuvers Known:** Choose your maneuvers from each class separately and then combine them into a single pool.\r\n- **Superiority Dice:** You add your superiority dice from each class together as a single pool.\r\n- **Die Size:** Add your levels in each class together and compare the total to any of your class's superiority tables to determine the size of your superiority die.\r\n\r\n### Unarmored Defense\r\nIf you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.\r\n\r\n### Force- and Tech-casting\r\nYour capacity for force- and tech-casting depends partly on your combined levels in all your force- or tech-casting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the force- or tech-casting feature from more than one class, use the rules \r\n\r\nbelow. If you multiclass but have the force- or tech-casting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.\r\n\r\n#### Powers Known \r\nYou determine what powers you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. If you are a scout 4/consular 3, for example, you know 6 tech powers of no higher than 1st-level. As a 3rd-level consular, you know 11 force powers of no higher than 2nd-level.\r\n\r\nEach power you know is associated with one of your classes, and you use the force- or tech-casting ability of that class when you cast the power. \r\n\r\n#### Force and Tech Points \r\nYou determine your available force or tech points by adding together the amount given by each class, but you only add your casting modifier once. \r\n\r\nIf you have both force and tech points, you keep your pools separate, and they can only be used to fuel force or tech powers, respectively.\r\n\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nWhen multiclassing, you determine your Max Power Level by dividing each class's potential Max Power Level by 9, multiplying the result by the number of levels in that class, adding the results for each class together, and consulting the Multiclass Max Power Level table below. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if you have four levels in Marauder Approach berserker (1.77) and three levels in guardian (1.67), you count as a 3rd-level character when determining your Max Power Level, which is 2. While you don't know any 2nd-level powers, you can cast powers you know at that level.\r\n\r\nIf you have both force- and tech-casting, you determine your Max Power Levels separately, and they can only be used to cast force or tech powers, respectively.\r\n\r\n##### Multiclass Max Power Level\r\n\r\n|Caster Level|Slot Level|\r\n|:---:|:--:|\r\n| 1st|1st|\r\n| 2nd|1st|\r\n| 3rd|2nd|\r\n| 4th|2nd|\r\n| 5th|3rd|\r\n| 6th|3rd|\r\n| 7th|4th|\r\n| 8th|4th|\r\n| 9th|5th|\r\n|10th|5th|\r\n\r\n|Caster Level|Slot Level|\r\n|:---:|:--:|\r\n|11th|6th|\r\n|12th|6th|\r\n|13th|7th|\r\n|14th|7th|\r\n|15th|8th|\r\n|16th|8th|\r\n|17th|9th|\r\n|18th|9th|\r\n|19th|9th|\r\n|20th|9th|\r\n\r\n#### High-Level Casting\r\nWhen determining the number of higher level powers you can cast before needing a long rest, consult the rules for casting in the class in which you have the most levels.\r\n\r\n## Feats\r\nA feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.\r\n\r\nYou must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Inspiring Leader feat requires you to have a Charisma of 13 or higher. If your Charisma is reduced below 13 somehow�perhaps by a withering curse�you can't benefit from the Inspiring Leader feat until your Charisma is restored.\r\n\r\n### Ace Pilot \r\nYou're quite experienced both on land and in the air, be it from time in a navy, as a mercenary, or perhaps even piracy. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- You gain proficiency in the Piloting skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. \r\n- Whenever you make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check related to vehicles or ships, you are considered to have expertise in the Investigation or Perception skill.\r\n\r\n### Acrobat \r\nYou become more nimble, gaining the following benefits: \r\n- Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20. \r\n- You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. \r\n- As a bonus action, you can make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you succeed, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement until the end of the current turn.\r\n\r\n### Actor\r\nSkilled at mimicry and dramatics, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person.\r\n- You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.\r\n\r\n### Alert\r\nAlways on the lookout for danger, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- You are proficient in Initiative checks..\r\n- You can't be surprised while you are conscious.\r\n- Other creatures don't gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being unseen by you.\r\n\r\n### Animal Handler \r\nYou master the techniques needed to train and handle animals. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20. \r\n- You gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. \r\n- You can use a bonus action on your turn to command one friendly beast within 60 feet of you that can hear you and that isn't currently following the command of someone else. You decide now what action the beast will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you issue a general command that lasts for 1 minute, such as to guard a particular area.\r\n\r\n### Armor Expert\r\nYou've learned how to fluidly move in armor, gaining the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- You gain proficiency with light armor. If you are already proficient with light armor, instead while you are wearing light armor, your speed increases by 5 feet. \r\n- If you are already proficient in light armor when you take this feat, you also gain proficiency in medium armor. If you are already proficient with medium armor, instead while you are wearing medium armor, you can add 3, rather than 2, to your AC if you have a Dexterity of 16 or higher, and you ignore the bulky property of medium armor. \r\n- If you are already proficient in medium armor when you take this feat, you also gain proficiency in heavy armor. If you are already proficient with heavy armor, instead while you are wearing heavy armor, critical hits made against you are treated as normal hits.\r\n\r\nYou can take this feat multiple times. \r\n\r\n### Athlete\r\nYou have undergone extensive physical training to gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- When you are prone, standing up uses only 5 feet of your movement.\r\n- Climbing doesn't cost you extra movement.\r\n- You can make a running long jump or a running high jump after moving only 5 feet on foot, rather than 10 feet.\r\n\r\n### Battle Scarred\r\nYou've spent a lifetime fighting, with the scars to prove it. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- When you roll a 19 or a 20 on the d20 for a death saving throw, you regain 1 hit point. \r\n- When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you've used this ability, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.\r\n\r\n### Bountiful Luck\r\n_**Prerequisite:** 4th level,_ Lucky _feat_\r\nYour people have extraordinary luck, which you have learned to lend to your companions when you see them falter. You're not sure how you do it; you just wish it, and it happens. Surely a sign of fortune's favor!\r\n\r\nWhen an ally you can see within 30 feet of you rolls a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and expend 1 luck point to let the ally reroll the die. The ally must use the new roll. When you use this ability, you can't use luck points before the end of your next turn. \r\n\r\n### Brawny \r\nYou become stronger, gaining the following benefits: \r\n- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20. \r\n- You gain proficiency in the Athletics skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. \r\n- Your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift doubles. If it would already double, it instead triples.\r\n\r\n### Charmer \r\nYou've master the art of charming those around you, gaining the following benefits: \r\n- Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20. \r\n- You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. \r\n- If you spend 1 minute talking to someone who can understand what you say, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by the creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. If you or your companions are fighting the creature, your check automatically fails. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you as long as it remains within 60 feet of you and for 1 minute thereafter. \r\n\r\n### Climber\r\nYou excel at scaling cliffsides, hills, trees, and general climbing. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20. \r\n- You gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed.\r\n- You have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid falling off or down while climbing. \r\n- You can spend 5 minutes instructing, pointing out handholds, and guiding other creatures before making a climb. When you do so, choose up to six friendly creatures (which can include yourself) within 30 feet of you. Each creature can add a 1d6 to any ability check or saving throw they make for that climb.\r\n\r\n### Competitor\r\nYou have a strong aptitude for competing. Select one gaming set. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- You gain proficiency in the chosen gaming set. If you are already proficient with it, you instead gain expertise with it.\r\n- As long as you spend at least 1 minute using your gaming set, you can't have disadvantage on Intelligence checks you make to use the gaming set, Charisma (Deception) checks you make to bluff with the gaming set, or Wisdom (Insight) checks you make to read an opponent with whom you are competing with the gaming set.\r\n\r\nYou can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different gaming set.\r\n\r\n### Commando\r\nYou've practiced fighting while prone, gaining the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- You gain a crawling speed equal to your movement speed.\r\n- While prone, you no longer have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls against targets within 30 feet due to being prone.\r\n- When you attempt to hide on your turn while prone, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, you are considered lightly obscured. You lose this benefit if you move or stand up, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden. If you are still hidden on your next turn, you can continue to remain motionless and gain this benefit until you are detected.\r\n\r\n### Crafter\r\nYou have a knack for crafting; you work with greater efficiency and produce goods of higher quality. Select one type of artisan's implements. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- You gain proficiency with the chosen tool. If you are already proficient with it, you instead gain expertise with it.\r\n- When you craft something with the chosen tool, the total market value you can craft increases 50 cr per day. If you have expertise with it, the market value instead increases by 100 cr per day.\r\n- If you use the tool you've selected to practice a profession during downtime, you can support a lifestyle one higher than you would normally be able to.\r\n\r\nYou can take this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different set of artisan's implements. \r\n\r\n### Dungeon Delver\r\nAlert to the hidden traps and secret doors found in many dungeons, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to detect the presence of secret doors.\r\n- You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps.\r\n- You have resistance to the damage dealt by traps. \r\n- Traveling at a fast pace no longer imposes a -5 penalty to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score.\r\n\r\n### Durable\r\nHardy and resilient, you gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- When you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you can regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2).\r\n- Your hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to twice your level when you gain this feat. Whenever you gain a level thereafter, your hit point maximum increases by an additional 2 hit points.\r\n\r\n### Empathic \r\nYou possess keen insight into how other people think and feel. You gain the following benefits: \r\n- Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20. \r\n- You gain proficiency in the Insight skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. \r\n- You can use your action to try to get uncanny insight about one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by the target's Charisma (Deception) check. On a success, you have advantage on attack rolls and ability checks against the target until the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n### Entertainer\r\nYou have a natural gift for performing. Select one musical instrument. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Increase an ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.\r\n- You gain proficiency in the chosen musical instrument. If you are already proficient with it, you instead gain expertise with it.\r\n- While playing your chosen musical instrument, you can always readily read the emotions of those paying attention to you.

You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Creatures within your reach provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action.\r\n- When you take the Dodge action, once per round, you can take two reactions on the same turn, instead of only one. You can only take one reaction per trigger.\r\n- You can use a bonus action to enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you have a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus that you can only use to make opportunity attacks.\r\n\r\n#### Sharpshooter Mastery\r\nYou've mastered blaster weapons and can easily make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.\r\n- Your ranged weapon attacks reduce partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter) against targets greater than 30 feet from you.

You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Your ranged weapon attacks reduce partial cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter) against targets within 30 feet of you. If the target has one-quarter cover, you ignore it entirely.\r\n- Other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move to within 30 feet of you, and you can make ranged weapon attacks with blaster weapons when making opportunity attacks.\r\n- When you take the Attack action targeting a creature within 30 feet while you are wielding a blaster weapon with which you are proficient, you can choose to attack rapidly at the expense of accuracy. Your ranged weapon attack is made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you can use your bonus action to make an additional ranged weapon attack, also without your proficiency bonus. If you would make more than one attack when you take the Attack action, only one attack is made without your proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Spotting Mastery\r\nYou've mastered keeping track of your surroundings, noticing things in detail that others miss entirely. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- You no longer have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks due to an area being lightly obscured in a 120 foot range. \r\n- When a creature rolls a d20 to redirect an attack roll you make to an illusory duplicate, they have disadvantage on the roll.\r\n- When you take the Search action, you give off no indication that you are devoting your attention to finding something.\r\n- When you find a hidden creature using the Search action, it has disadvantage on any ability checks it makes to attempt Hide from you before the start of your next turn.\r\n- When you take the Search action, you have advantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws made as a part of that search that occur within a radius in feet equal to 5 x your proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Split Mastery\r\nYou've mastered fighting with interlocking weapons, seamlessly transitioning between twin blades and dual wielding.

If you do so, you can make an additional attack with that weapon, also without your proficiency bonus. If you would normally make more than one attack with your bonus action, only one attack is made without your proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\n#### Superiority Mastery\r\nYou've mastered utilizing maneuvers to enhance your skills on the battlefield, *expanded*. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- You learn one maneuver, detailed in Chapter 13. If you already know at least one maneuver, you instead learn three maneuvers.

If you already have at least one superiority die, you instead gain two additional superiority dice. Your superiority die is a d4, and it changes as you gain levels: to d6 at 5th level, to d8 at 9th level, to d10 at 13th level, and to d12 at 17th level. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n- When you use a maneuver on your turn that involves rolling a superiority die, you can use your bonus action to gain advantage on the superiority die roll.\r\n- Choose one maneuver you know. When you would use the chosen maneuver, you can use a d4 instead of expending a superiority die. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.\r\n\r\n#### Throwing Mastery\r\nYou've mastered the techniques of throwing weapons, readily blending the weapons with your movements. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls with thrown weapons.\r\n- When you hit a creature with a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, you have advantage on your next melee weapon attack against that creature before the end of your next turn.\r\n\r\n- Once per turn, you can draw a thrown weapon without using your object interaction.\r\n- Once on each of your turns, you can make a ranged weapon attack with a thrown weapon against a target within the weapon's normal range without the aid of your proficiency bonus (no action required).\r\n\r\n#### Twin-Blade Mastery\r\nYou've mastered fighting with double-bladed weapons, using both ends to devastating effect. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- While you are wielding a double weapon with which you are proficient, whenever you roll the maximum on a weapon damage die against a creature, you gain a +1 bonus to the next attack roll you make against that creature before the end of your next turn.\r\n- You can engage in Double-Weapon Fighting even when the weapon you are wielding lacks the light property.\r\n- Before you make a melee weapon attack while wielding a double weapon in two hands, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you add one and a half times your proficiency bonus to the attack's damage.\r\n- Before you make a melee weapon attack while wielding a double weapon in one hand, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you add your proficiency bonus to the attack's damage.\r\n\r\n#### Versatile Mastery\r\nYou've mastered using weapons in different ways, altering your attack patterns mid-swing. You gain the following benefits:\r\n- Once per turn, when you make a melee attack roll while wielding a weapon in two hands, you can attempt to follow up on the attack. If the attack hits, the creature must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, the creature is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.\r\n- Once per turn, when you make a melee attack roll while wielding a weapon in one hand, the target is wielding a shield, and your other hand is empty, you can use your other hand to pull down the shield (no action required). If you do so, the creature gains no benefit to armor class from its shield for that attack.\r\n- Before you make a melee weapon attack while wielding a versatile weapon in two hands, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you add one and a half times your proficiency bonus to the attack's damage.\r\n- Before you make a melee weapon attack while wielding a versatile weapon in one hand, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you add your proficiency bonus to the attack's damage.\r\n\r\n## Lightsaber Forms\r\nCertain class features, Formfighting Style, or Formfighting Mastery, offer your choice of lightsaber forms. You can't choose a lightsaber form more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\r\n\r\nYou may choose your lightsaber forms from the following options or roll on the table below to determine them randomly.\r\n\r\n|d20|Lightsaber Form|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1|Aqinos|\r\n|2|Ataru|\r\n|3|Bakuuni Hand|\r\n|4|Djem So|\r\n|5|Drallig|\r\n|6|Ishu|\r\n|7|Jar'Kai|\r\n|8|Juyo|\r\n|9|Makashi|\r\n|10|Niman|\r\n\r\n|d20|Lightsaber Form|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|11|Shien|\r\n|12|Shii-Cho|\r\n|13|Soresu|\r\n|14|Sokan|\r\n|15|Trakata|\r\n|16|Trispzest|\r\n|17|Twilight|\r\n|18|Vaapad|\r\n|19|Vonil|\r\n|20|Ysannite|\r\n\r\nEach known form can be adopted on your turn by using your bonus action.\r\n\r\n#### Aqinos Form\r\n_**Prerequisite:** The ability to cast tech powers_\r\nAs a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, if you cast a tech power of 1st level or higher as your action, but no higher than half your Max Power Level, you can make one melee weapon attack.\r\n\r\n#### Ataru Form\r\nAs a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, you can leap up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.\r\n\r\n#### Bakuuni Hand Form\r\nAs a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, if you took the Attack action and would be able to use your bonus action to make an unarmed strike, you can do so as a part of this bonus action.\r\n\r\nUntil the start of your next turn, when a creature enters your reach or moves while within your reach, you can use your reaction to attempt to shove the creature. On a success, you can choose shove the target an additional 5 feet.\r\n\r\n#### Djem So Form\r\nBefore the end of your next turn, you can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) to one ability check or attack roll you make using Strength. \r\n\r\n#### Drallig Form\r\nUntil the start of your next turn, you gain a special reaction.

You must end this movement within 5 feet of the friendly creature.\r\n\r\n#### Jar'Kai Form\r\nAs a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting. \r\n\r\nEach time you hit with an attack on this turn, you can move up to 5 feet without provoking opportunity attacks from the creature you hit. \r\n\r\n#### Juyo Form\r\nUntil the start of your next turn, your critical hit range with weapons increases by 1.\r\n\r\n#### Makashi Form\r\nUntil the start of your next turn, you gain a special reaction. When a creature makes a melee weapon attack against you and misses, you can use this special reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature. \r\n\r\n#### Niman Form\r\nAs a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting. \r\n\r\nUntil the end of your next turn, you can use Wisdom or Charisma instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls of your melee weapon attacks. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.\r\n\r\n#### Soresu Form\r\nThe first time you take kinetic, energy, or ion damage from a weapon before the end of your next turn, that damage is reduced by half.\r\n\r\n#### Shien Form\r\nBefore the end of your next turn, you can add half your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice, minimum of +1) to your AC against one attack. \r\n\r\n#### Shii-Cho Form\r\nAs a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, if you took the Attack action, you can engage in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the first time you hit a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you with a weapon attack before the end of your next turn, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, it is pushed back 5 feet, and you can immediately move into the space it just vacated without provoking opportunity attacks.\r\n\r\n#### Sokan Form\r\nUntil the start of your next turn, you ignore difficult terrain.

On a success, that creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against you.\r\n\r\n#### Trispzest Form \r\nOnce before the start of your next turn, you have advantage on a melee weapon attack against a creature that is frightened of you.\r\n\r\n#### Twilight Form\r\nAs a part of the bonus action to adopt this form, you can mask yourself with the force to attempt to hide from an enemy you can see. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by a Wisdom (Perception) check of one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. On a success, you become invisible to that creature until the start of your next turn, or until you attack, cast a power, or otherwise take a hostile action against it.\r\n\r\n#### Vaapad Form\r\nOnce before the start of your next turn, if you would have advantage on a melee weapon attack, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do so, you can make one melee weapon attack against the same target (no action required), also without advantage.\r\n\r\n#### Vonil Form\r\nIf you took the Attack action before adopting this form, you can direct one of your allies to strike a creature you hit with an attack. Choose a friendly creature that can see or hear you and is within 5 feet of the creature you hit with an attack.

In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to speeders and spaceships.\t\t\r\n\r\nFor an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a stronghold or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&D present.\r\n\r\n##### Variant: Starting Wealth by Class\r\n\r\n|\tClass\t\t|\tFunds\t|\r\n|:--|--:|\r\n|   Berserker |   5d4 x 100 cr  |\r\n|   Consular  |   5d4 x 100 cr  |\r\n|   Engineer  |   6d4 x 100 cr  |\r\n|   Fighter   |\t8d4 x 100 cr  |\r\n|   Guardian  |\t8d4 x 100 cr  |\r\n\r\n|\tClass\t\t|\tFunds\t|\r\n|:--|--:|\r\n|   Monk      |\t4d4 x 100 cr  |\r\n|   Operative |\t7d4 x 100 cr  |\r\n|   Scholar   |\t6d4 x 100 cr  |\r\n|   Scout     |\t8d4 x 100 cr  |\r\n|   Sentinel  |\t6d4 x 100 cr  |\r\n\r\n## Wealth\r\nWealth generally appears in the form of credits. The Galactic Republic and Sith Empire have their own mints, but in most worlds, the chits are interchangeable. Other trade goods, gemstones, artifacts, and property can reflect your character's financial well-being. Members of the lower class trade in goods, bartering for what they need and paying taxes in raw materials. Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such as the rights to a mine, a port, or a company, or in high denomination credits. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in credits.\r\n\r\n### Currency\r\nCredits come in a variety of denominations: from a single chit to cards loaded with incredible value. While the Republic and Empire have their own currencies, in most worlds they can be used interchangeably.\r\n \r\nWith ten credits, a character can buy a power cell, a stylus, or a glowrod. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn ten credits a day. The credit is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the chit itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of credits, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual chits. Rather, the credit is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in credit cards, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\t\t\t\r\n \r\nA standard chit weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty chits weigh a pound.\t\r\n\r\n### Selling Treasure\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nOpportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.\r\n\r\n#### Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment\r\nAs a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Used weapons and armor aren't always in good enough condition to sell.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n    \r\n#### Enhanced Items\r\nSelling enhanced items can be problematic. Finding someone to find an overtuned blaster isn't hard, but the most unique of items are beyond all but the wealthiest denizens. Likewise, aside from a few common enhanced items, you won't normally come across enhanced items to purchase. The value of special equipment is far beyond simple credits and should always be treated as such.\r\n\r\n#### Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects\r\nThese items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for credits or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large city or even another planet.\r\n\r\n#### Trade Goods\r\nIn the Outer Rim, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods�raw materials like bags of salt, livestock, and so on�retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency.\r\n\r\n### At Higher Levels\r\nAs characters progress to higher levels, there is an expectation of increased wealth, be it in the shape of coin or equipment. The below table serves as a target for how much each character should have earned at certain levels.\r\n\r\n##### Wealth by Level\r\n\r\n|Level|Wealth|\r\n|:--:|--:|\r\n|1st|�|\r\n|2nd|1,000 cr|\r\n|3rd|2,500 cr|\r\n|4th|5,000 cr|\r\n|5th|10,000 cr|\r\n|6th|20,000 cr|\r\n|7th|35,000 cr|\r\n|8th|50,000 cr|\r\n|9th|75,000 cr|\r\n|10th|125,000 cr|\r\n\r\n|Level|Wealth|\r\n|:--:|--:|\r\n|11th|175,000 cr|\r\n|12th|250,000 cr|\r\n|13th|350,000 cr|\r\n|14th|500,000 cr|\r\n|15th|750,000 cr|\r\n|16th|1,250,000 cr|\r\n|17th|2,500,000 cr|\r\n|18th|5,000,000 cr|\r\n|19th|7,500,000 cr|\r\n|20th|10,000,000 cr|\r\n\r\n## Armor and Shields\r\nThe different worlds of *Star Wars* are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from basic combat suits to heavy battle armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.\r\n\r\nThe Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in the worlds of *Star Wars*.\r\n\r\n### Armor and Shield Proficiency\r\nAnyone can put on a suit of armor or wield a shield. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor or wield a shield that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't force- or tech-cast.\r\n\r\nIf you have proficiency in armor, you have proficiency in the appropriate shield as well.\r\n\r\n> #### Variant: Equipment Sizes\r\n> In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly wookiee won't fit in a jawa's combat suit, and an ugnaught would be swallowed up in a gamorrean's hooded cloak. \r\n> The GM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard's uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.\r\n> Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armormech, synthweaver, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The GM can either roll 1d4x10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.\r\n\r\n### Armor Class (AC)\r\nArmor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your armor class (AC).\r\n\r\n### Armor Properties\r\nMany armors and shield have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Armor table.\r\n\r\n#### Bulky\r\nWhile wearing armor with this property, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sound.\r\n\r\n#### Obtrusive\r\nWhile wielding a shield with this property, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on sight.\r\n\r\n#### Strength\r\nWhile wearing armor or wielding a shield with this property, your speed is reduced by 10 unless your Strength score meets or exceeds the strength number. \r\n\r\n### Light Armor\r\nMade from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\r\n\r\n#### Combat Suit\r\nCombat suits are seen all over the galaxy, and can be found for sale by almost any merchant who dealt in weapons and armor. Many such suits are used by military organizations, such as the Galactic Republic's military, as well as by mercenaries, criminals, bounty hunters and even some Jedi.\r\n\r\nThe suit itself offers decent protection from most types of attacks while maintaining maximum flexibility and minimum weight. However this armor is only recommended for light skirmishes.\r\n\r\n#### Fiber Armor\r\nFiber armor is a type of armor that offers more protection than the lighter combat suit. Fiber armor is heavier overall than combat suits, and not quite as flexible, but many consider the trade-offs worthwhile. It is a good source of defense from physical attacks and light blaster fire.\r\n\r\n### Medium Armor\r\nMedium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\r\n\r\n#### Mesh armor\r\nProviding solid protection for a minimal cost, mesh armor is considered excellent protection for entrenched troops or guards. However, this protection comes at a cost of mobility, limiting its uses by rapidly advancing infantry. Still, it provides more mobility than battle armor.\r\n\r\n#### Weave Armor\r\nWeave armor was constructed from a mesh of metal or composite plates and a padded jumpsuit. Variants of the armor included less plates and more padding for a lighter, though less protect-ive armor, and heavier plating with molded pieces to fit the wearer. Though the armor was available unmodified, most users personalized their armor.\r\n\r\n#### Composite Armor\r\nComposite armor is a type of armored suit that offers a good balance of mobility and protection against most types of weapons. The micro-hydraulics of this type of powered armor provide the operator with protection, but are more bulky than mesh or weave armors. This type of armor is rarely seen outside of professional mercenaries' and soldiers' use.\r\n\r\n### Heavy Armor\r\nOf all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.\r\n\r\n#### Battle Armor\r\nBattle armor is an armor that reduced weight, but restricts movement. The armor is commonly used by mercenaries, bounty hunters, soldiers, and civilians that live in dangerous areas.\r\n\r\n#### Assault Armor\r\nAssault armor improved on battle armor, with the benefit of micro-hydraulics that boost the efficacy of the operator. It offers better protection, but increased weight.\r\n\r\n#### Heavy Exoskeleton\r\nHeavy exoskeletons are virtually the heaviest armor acquirable during the Galactic War. It is ideal for extreme combat situations that involved direct damage and also offers a very good level of protection in sacrifice of dexterity. Some consider it claustrophobic but that was the trade-off for safety.\r\n\r\n### Shields\r\nShields come in varying weights, sizes, and materials. Light shields are smaller and mounted to the forearm, while medium and heavy shields are held in hand. You can only benefit from one shield at a time.\r\n\r\n***Physical Shields.*** Physical shields are made entirely of physical materials. They are cheaper than their generator counterparts, but heavier. \r\n\r\n***Shield Generators.*** Shield generators are made almost entirely of energy barriers. Medium and heavy shield generators have a physical handheld component from which the barrier emanates; medium shield generators are orbs that are slightly larger than a fist, while heavy shield generators project from a large cross.\r\n\r\n#### Light Shields\r\nA light shield is generally affixed to the forearm. While a light shield does not fill the hand, you gain no benefit from it while the hand is full. You gain no benefit from a light shield while wielding a weapon with the heavy property.\r\n\r\n#### Medium Shields\r\nA medium shield is a common defensive technology that protects the user from blaster fire, the elements, or other hazards. Medium shields are used in conjunction with any one-handed weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Heavy Shields\r\nHeavy shields are much larger and more cumbersome, but they offer more protection than their smaller counterparts. Their unwieldy size, however, requires the use of a one-handed weapon with the light property in the other hand.\r\n\r\n##### Armor and Shields\r\n|Name|Cost|Armor|Weight|Properties| \r\n|:---|---:|:---|-:|:---|\r\n|_Light Armor_\t||||||\r\n| Combat suit      \t\t|\t 100 cr|\t11 + Dex modifier|10.00 lb|�|\r\n| Fiber armor\t\t        |\t 450 cr|\t12 + Dex modifier|13.00 lb|�|\r\n|_Medium Armor_\t||||||\r\n| Mesh armor\t\t        |\t 500 cr|\t13 + Dex modifier (max 2)|20 lb|�|\r\n| Weave armor\t\t\t    |  1,000 cr|\t14 + Dex modifier (max 2)|25 lb|�|\r\n| Composite armor\t        |  2,500 cr|\t15 + Dex modifier (max 2)|45 lb|Bulky|\r\n|_Heavy Armor_\t||||||\r\n| Battle armor\t\t\t    |    750 cr|\t16\t|55 lb|Bulky, strength 13|\r\n| Assault armor\t        |  2,000 cr|\t17\t|60 lb|Bulky, strength 15|\r\n| Heavy exoskeleton   \t    |  9,000 cr|\t18\t|65 lb|Bulky, strength 17|\r\n|_Shield_\t\t||||||\r\n| Light physical shield    |     50 cr|\t+1\t| 6.00 lb|�|\r\n| Light shield generator\t|    125 cr|\t+1\t| 2.00 lb|�|\r\n| Medium physical shield   |\t 150 cr|\t+2\t|18.00 lb|Strength 13|\r\n| Medium shield generator\t|\t 375 cr|\t+2\t| 6.00 lb|�|\r\n| Heavy physical shield\t|\t 500 cr|\t+3\t|36.00 lb|Obtrusive, strength 15|\r\n| Heavy shield generator\t|  1,250 cr|\t+3\t|12.00 lb|�|\r\n\r\n### Getting Into and Out of Armor\r\nThe time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category. If you have help, you can reduce the time it takes to don or doff armor by half.\r\n\r\n***Don.*** This is the time it takes to put on armor or wield your shield. You benefit from the armor only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.\r\n\r\n***Doff.*** This is the time it takes to remove armor or store your shield. \r\n\r\n### Donning and Doffing Armor\r\n|Category| Don| Doff|\r\n|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n|Light armor| 1 minute| 1 minute|\r\n|Medium armor| 5 minutes| 1 minute|\r\n|Heavy armor| 10 minutes| 5 minutes|\r\n|Light shield| 1 reaction| 1 reaction|\r\n|Medium shield| 1 bonus action| 1 bonus action|\r\n|Heavy shield| 1 action | 1 action |\r\n\r\n## Weapons\r\nYour class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a vibroweapon or a blaster, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring. The Weapons tables show the most common weapons used in the worlds of *Star Wars*, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as a blaster, lightweapon, or vibroweapon. A vibroweapon or lightweapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a blaster is used to attack a target at a distance. Lightweapons are generally used in melee, but due to their nature require separate proficiency.\r\n\r\n### Weapon Proficiency\r\nYour species, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons, which are commonly seen in the hands of the unspecialized, with proficiency. Martial weapons, such as vibroswords or sniper rifles, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use. Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.\r\n\r\n### Improvised Weapons\r\nSometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead jawa.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. At the GM's discretion, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\nAn object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 kinetic damage. If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\r\n\r\n### Weapon Properties\r\nMany weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.\r\n\r\n#### Auto\r\nWeapons with this property can only fire in burst, penetrating, or rapid modes. If the weapon has any combination of burst, penetrating, and rapid modes, you choose which mode to use. You can only use one mode at a time.\r\n\r\n#### Burst\r\nWhen you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead spray a 10-foot-cube area within range with shots, consuming ammunition equal to the burst number. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or take the weapon's normal damage. Before you use this property, you can declare one creature that would be affected by it. If the creature fails its save, in addition to the weapon's normal damage, it is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.\r\n\r\n#### Dexterity\r\nA weapon with this property requires more skill to control. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Dexterity requirement. \r\n\r\n#### Disguised\r\nYou have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to hide the nature of a weapon with this property.\r\n\r\n#### Double\r\nA weapon with this property can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property�the damage when the weapon is used with Double-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.\r\n\r\n#### Finesse\r\nWhen making an attack with a weapon with this property, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed\r\nA weapon with this property does not fill the hand, but you can't use the weapon while the hand is full. Additionally, you have a +10 bonus to ability checks and saving throws to avoid being disarmed of this weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Heavy\r\nWhen you hit with an attack roll using Strength with a weapon with this property, you deal additional damage equal to half your Strength modifier (minimum of +1).\r\n\r\n#### Hidden\r\nYou have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to conceal a weapon with this property.\r\n\r\n#### Interlocking\r\nWhile wielding a weapon with the interlocking property, you can use your object interaction to detach the weapon into two separate weapons or reattach into a single weapon. While separated, each weapon has the same damage, damage type, combined value and weight, and properties (except for the double property) as the single weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Light\r\nA weapon with this property is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when engaging in Double- or Two-Weapon Fighting. See the rules for Double- and Two-Weapon Fighting in chapter 9.\r\n\r\n#### Luminous\r\nA weapon with this property sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius while activated. Additionally, Dexterity (Stealth) checks made while the weapon is activated have disadvantage.\r\n\r\n#### Penetrating \r\nWhen you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead attempt to penetrate and hit a creature behind the target, consuming ammunition equal to the penetrating number. Make an attack roll against the initial target. If the attack hits, there is a creature within 15 feet of that creature and directly behind it, and the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it also takes normal weapon damage. Alternatively, you can use this property to fire at a creature through partial cover. When you do so, you reduce the target's cover by one step (from three-quarters to half or half to one-quarter), rather than targeting a second creature.\r\n\r\n#### Power Cell\r\nWeapons with this property are fueled by power cells, which must be loaded in order to fire the weapon. A power cell fuels a number of attacks equal to the weapon's reload number.\r\n\r\n#### Range\r\nA weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has this property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.\r\n\r\n#### Rapid\r\nWhen you would make a ranged weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead unload on a single target, consuming ammunition equal to the rapid number. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, roll the weapon's damage dice twice and add them together, adding relevant modifiers as normal and subjecting the target to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If you would have advantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has disadvantage on their saving throw, and if you would have disadvantage on your attack roll, the creature instead has advantage on their saving throw.\r\n\r\n#### Reach\r\nA weapon with this property adds 5 feet to your reach with it.\r\n\r\n#### Reload\r\nA number of shots equal to the reload number can be made with a weapon with this property. A character must then reload it using an action or a bonus action (their choice). You must have one free hand to reload.\r\n\r\n#### Returning \r\nWhen you throw a weapon with this property, it automatically returns to your hand after the attack is complete, whether you hit or miss.\r\n\r\n#### Slug Cartridge\r\nWeapons with this property fire slug cartridges, which must be loaded in order to fire the weapon.\r\n\r\n#### Special\r\nA weapon with this property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see \"Special Weapons\" later in this section).\r\n\r\n#### Strength\r\nA weapon with this property has a heavy kickback. While wielding it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Strength requirement. If the weapon has the burst, penetrating, or rapid property, you must meet the Strength requirement to use this feature. If the weapon lacks the two-handed property, you can wield the weapon in two hands to temporarily reduce the strength number by one step (from 19 to 17, 17 to 15, 15 to 13, or 13 to 11). If this would reduce the strength number below 11, you ignore it entirely.\r\n\r\n#### Thrown\r\nWeapons with this property can be thrown to make a ranged attack. If the weapon would normally be used to make melee weapon attacks, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. \r\n\r\n#### Two-Handed\r\nA weapon with this property requires two hands to use.\r\n\r\n#### Versatile\r\nA weapon with this property can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property�the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.\t\r\n\r\n### Special Weapons\r\nWeapons with special rules are described below.\r\n\r\n#### Net\r\nA Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on formless or Huge or larger creatures. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has an AC of 10, 5 hit points, and immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons. Destroying the net frees the creature without harming it and immediately ends the net's effects. While a creature is restrained by a net, you can make no further attacks with it.\r\n\r\n#### Vibrodart\r\nDue to their diminutive size, vibrodarts make ineffective melee weapons. Melee attack rolls made with them are made at disadvantage.\r\n\r\n#### Wrist Launcher\r\nRather than traditional power cells, the wrist launcher fires specialized projectiles in the form of darts, small missiles, or specialized canisters. \r\n\r\n##### Blasters\r\n|Name|Cost|Damage|Weight|Properties| \r\n|:---|---:|:---|-:|:---|\r\n|\t_Simple Blasters_\t|||||\r\n| Blaster carbine\t\t|425 cr

The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.\r\n\r\n#### Ram, Portable\r\nYou can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.\r\n\r\n#### Restraining Bolt\r\nRestraining bolts are small, cylindrical devices that can be affixed to a droid in order to limit its functions and enforce its obedience. When inserted, a restraining bolt restricts the droid from any movement its master does not desire, and also forced it to respond to signals produced by a hand-held control unit. \r\n\r\nInstalling a restraining bolt takes 1 minute. The droid must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. A hostile droid makes this save with advantage. On a successful save, the restraining bolt overloads and is rendered useless. On a failed save, the restraining bolt is correctly installed, and the control unit can be used to actively control the droid. While the control unit is inactive, the droid can act freely but it can not attempt to remove the restraining bolt. \r\n\r\n### Weapon and Armor Accessories\r\n#### Bandolier\r\nA bandolier is worn across the chest. It has 12 pockets that can each hold a single item that weighs less than 2.00 lb, such as a vibrodagger, a fragmentation grenade, or a power cell. Once per turn, drawing an item from a bandolier does not require your object interaction.\r\n\r\n#### Bipod\r\nA bipod is a device mounted to a two-handed blaster that lacks the fixed property to offer increased stability while prone.

Tools\r\nA tool helps you to do something you couldn't otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, pick a lock, or slice into a computer. Your species, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. Like skills, proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it. Unlike skills, you must have your tools present in order to make an ability check with them. \r\n\r\nThe table shows examples of some of the most common types of tools. Each tool falls under one of four categories: artisan's implements, gaming sets, musical instruments, or specialist's kits. Each tool requires a separate proficiency. \r\n\r\n#### Artisan's Implements\r\nArtisan's implements are predominantly designed for building and crafting things of permanent nature. Each set of implements focuses on a specific craft. \r\n\r\n***Armormech's Implements.*** Armormech's implements are for crafting and repairing armor and shields.\r\n\r\n***Armstech's Implements.*** Armstech's implements are for crafting and repairing blasters and vibroweapons.\r\n\r\n***Artificer's Implements.*** Artificer's implements are for creating lightweapons.\r\n\r\n***Astrotech's Implements.*** Astrotech's implements are for crafting and modifying droids.\r\n\r\n***Biotech's Implements.*** Biotech's implements are used to create cybernetic augmentations.\r\n\r\n***Cybertech's Implements.*** Cybertech's implements are used for crafting and modifying wristpads.\r\n\r\n***Gadgeteer's Implements.*** Gadgeteer's implements are used for crafting many types of adventuring gear, such as jet packs or friction-grip gear.\r\n\r\n***Tinker's Implements.*** Tinker's implements are general use tools that can craft small and versatile trinkets.\r\n\r\n#### Gaming Sets\r\nThis item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and/or decks of cards. A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. \r\n\r\n#### Musical Instruments\r\nSeveral of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. Musical instruments can often be used in place of�or in addition to�a performance.\r\n\r\n#### Specialist's Kits\r\nLike artisan's implements, specialist's kits are need to pursue a craft or trade. Some specialist's kits are used to craft items that are impermanent, such as grenades, medpacs, or poisons while other tools are used to achieve a specific purpose, such as picking locks or creating a disguise.\r\n\r\n***Biochemist's Kit.*** Biochemist's kits are used to create and enhance medpacs and other healing implements.\r\n\r\n***Chef's Kit.*** Chef's kits are used to prepare food and identify food that might be spoiled or tampered with.\r\n\r\n***Demolitions Kit.*** Demolitions kits are used to create, enhance, and disarm explosives.\r\n\r\n***Disguise Kit.*** Disguise kits are used to modify a creature's appearance, to hide their appearance or to mimic the appearance of others.\r\n\r\n***Forgery Kit.*** Forgery kits create false document and certifications, both physical and digital.\r\n\r\n***Mechanic's Kit.*** Mechanic's kits are used to craft and repair vehicles and starships.\r\n\r\n***Poisoner's Kit.*** Poisoner's kits are designed to create and identify poisons.\r\n\r\n***Security Kit.*** Security kits are used to bypass physical locks.\r\n\r\n***Slicer's Kit.*** Slicer's kits can bypass computerized defenses and locks.\r\n\r\n***Trapper's Kit.*** Trapper's kits can create, disarm, and disassemble traps.\r\n\r\n##### Tools\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n|\tItem\t\t|\tCost\t|\tWeight\t|\r\n|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|\t_Artisan's implements_\t\t|\t\t|\t\t|\r\n|\tArmormech's implements\t\t\t|\t200 cr\t|\t8.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tArmstech's implements\t\t\t|\t250 cr\t|\t9.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tArtificer's implements\t\t\t|\t300 cr\t|\t5.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tAstrotech's implements\t\t\t|\t400 cr\t|  12.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tBiotech's implements     \t\t|\t450 cr\t|\t6.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tCybertech's implements\t\t\t|\t500 cr\t|  10.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tGadgeteer's implements\t\t\t|\t350 cr\t|\t7.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tTinker's implements\t\t\t|\t500 cr\t|  10.00 lb\t|\r\n|\t_Gaming sets_\t\t|\t\t|\t\t|\r\n|\tChance cubes\t\t\t\t|\t  1 cr\t|\t  � \t|\r\n|\tDejarik set\t\t\t\t|\t300 cr\t|\t8.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tPazaak deck\t\t\t\t|\t100 cr\t|\t  �\t\t|\r\n|\tSabacc deck     \t\t\t|\t150 cr\t|\t  �\t\t|\r\n|\t_Musical instruments_\t\t|\t\t|\t\t|\r\n|\tDrum\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t 60 cr\t|\t3.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tFlute\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t 20 cr\t|\t1.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tLute\t\t\t\t\t\t|\t350 cr\t|\t2.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tOmmni box\t\t\t\t\t|\t250 cr\t|  10.00 lb\t|\r\n|\t_Specialist's kit_\t\t|\t\t|\t\t|\r\n|\tBiochemist's kit\t\t        |\t500 cr\t|\t8.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tChef's kit                    |\t 70 cr\t|\t8.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tDemolitions kit\t\t\t\t|\t400 cr\t|\t4.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tDisguise kit\t\t\t\t\t|\t250 cr\t|\t3.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tForgery kit\t\t\t\t\t|\t150 cr\t|\t5.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tMechanic's kit\t\t\t\t|\t650 cr\t|  25 lb\t|\r\n|\tPoisoner's kit\t\t\t\t|\t500 cr\t|\t2.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tSecurity kit\t\t\t\t\t|\t650 cr\t|\t3.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tSlicer's kit\t\t\t\t\t|\t800 cr\t|\t6.00 lb\t|\r\n|\tTrapper's kit\t\t\t\t\t|\t300 cr\t|  12.00 lb\t|\r\n\r\n## Expenses\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWhen not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.\r\n\r\n### Lifestyle Expenses\t\t\t\t\t\r\nLifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character's career.\r\n\r\nYour lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.\r\n\r\n##### Lifestyle Expenses\t\t\t\t\t\r\n|\tLifestyle\t\t|\tPrice/Day\t|\r\n|:--|--:|\r\n|\tWretched\t\t|\t�\t|\r\n|\tSqualid\t\t|\t1 cr\t|\r\n|\tPoor\t\t|\t2 cr\t|\r\n|\tModest\t\t|\t10 cr\t|\r\n|\tComfortable\t\t|\t20 cr\t|\r\n|\tWealthy\t\t|\t40 cr\t|\r\n|\tAristocratic\t\t|\tat least 100 cr \t|\r\n\r\n#### Wretched\r\nYou live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.\r\n\r\n#### Squalid\r\nYou live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and\r\n\r\nmisfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed diseased.\r\n\r\n#### Poor\r\nA poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a cantina. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\r\n\r\n#### Modest\r\nA modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, and the like.\r\n\r\n#### Comfortable\r\nChoosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small domicile in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine establishment. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.\r\n\r\n#### Wealthy\r\nChoosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.\r\n\r\n#### Aristocratic\r\nYou live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of the affluent. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.\t\r\n\r\n### Food, Drink, and Lodging\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night's lodging.

Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\r\n> Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn't require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, as described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.\r\n\r\n### Services\r\nAdventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.\r\n\r\nSome of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a fighter might commission an armstech to craft a special vibroblade, while a scholar might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming meeting with a senator. \r\n\r\nOther hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a trandoshan army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the facilities clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.\r\n\r\n##### Services\r\n|\tService\t\t|\tCost\t|\r\n|:--|:--|\r\n|\t_Speeder_\t\t|\t\t|\r\n|\t\tBetween towns\t|\t3 cr per mile\t|\r\n|\t\tWithin a city\t|   2 cr\t|\r\n|\t_Hireling_\t\t|\t\t|\r\n|\t\tSkilled\t        |  20 cr per day\t|\r\n|\t\tUntrained\t    |\t2 cr per day\t|\r\n|\tMessenger\t\t                    |\t1 cr per mile\t|\r\n|\tTolls\t\t                        |\t1 cr\t        |\r\n|   Interplanetary Travel               | 100 cr per day per person   |","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"5","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Force- and Tech-casting","chapterNumber":10,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 10: Force- and Tech-casting\r\n\r\nMagic exists in the worlds of *Star Wars* in the form of powers. This chapter provides the rules for casting these powers. There are two major sources of these power: the Force and technology. While multiple classes use the Force or technology to fuel their powers, there are only the two sources. Regardless, powers follow the rules here.\r\n\r\n## What is a Power?\r\nA power is a discrete enhanced effect, a single shaping of the energies of the Force or a result of a technological formula, that creates a desired effect. In casting a power, a character carefully constructs the desired effect using the source of their power, and then releases it, all in the span of seconds.\r\n\r\nPowers can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.\r\n\r\nA great number of powers exist, and over time many have been created and forgotten. An ancient force technique may exist in a long-lost holocron, or a piece of Rakatan schemata may contain revolutionary tech.\r\n\r\n### Power Level\r\nEvery power has a level from 0 to 9. A power's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly *burst of speed* at 1st level and the powerful *greater explosion* at 9th. At-will powers�simple but effective powers that characters can cast almost by rote�are level 0. The higher a power's level, the higher level a force- or tech-caster must be to use that power.\r\n\r\nPower level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level power.\r\n\r\n### Known Powers\r\nBefore a force- or tech-caster can use a power, he or she must have the power learned, or must have access to the power in an enhanced item. Once a power is learned, it is always prepared. The number of powers a caster can have at any given time depends on the character's level. \r\n\r\nWhen you learn a power, either an at-will, 1st-level, or higher, you choose from the list of powers provided in Chapters 11 and 12. You can learn powers from any level up to your Max Power Level, including at-will powers. The total number of powers you learn in this way can't exceed your Force or Tech Powers Known for your class.\r\n\r\nIf a power is granted to you by a class feature, that power does not count against your powers known and you can't voluntarily unlearn it. If you already know that power, you may learn an additional power that is available to you.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, every time you learn a new power as a result of gaining a level, you can choose one of the powers you know and replace it with another power of the same type, as long as that power is not of a higher level than your Max Power Level.\r\n\r\n### Force and Tech Points\r\nRegardless of how many powers a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of powers before resting. Manipulating the Force and channeling its energy into even a simple power is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level powers are even more so. Thus, each casting class's description includes a table showing how many force or tech points a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level consular Umara with 17 Wisdom has 15 force points.\r\n\r\nWhen a character casts a power, he or she expends a number of points based on the level of the power to create the slot to cast it. At-will powers always cost 0 points, while casting a power at any other level costs the power level + 1 points, as shown in the Power Level Point Cost table below. When Umara casts *project*, a 1st-level power, she spends two of her 12 force points, leaving 10 remaining.\r\n\r\nFinishing a long rest restores any expended force points, and finishing a short or long rest restores any expended tech points (see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).\r\n\r\n> ##### Casting in Armor\r\n> Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for force- and tech-casting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a power. You are otherwise too distracted and hampered by your armor for force- or tech-casting.\r\n\r\n#### Casting a Power at a Higher Level\r\nWhen a caster casts a power using at a higher level than the power's normal level, the power assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts *project* at 2nd-level, she uses three force points and that *project* is 2nd level. \r\n\r\nMany powers have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as indicated in the ***Force Potency*** and ***Overcharge Tech*** sections of the power's description\r\n\r\n##### Power Level Point Cost\r\n\r\n| Power Level | Point Cost |\r\n|:---:|:-----------:|\r\n|  0  |  0  |\r\n|  1  |  2  |\r\n|  2  |  3  |\r\n|  3  |  4  |\r\n|  4  |  5  |\r\n\r\n| Power Level | Point Cost |\r\n|:---:|:-----------:|\r\n|  5  |  6  |\r\n|  6  |  7  |\r\n|  7  |  8  |\r\n|  8  |  9  |\r\n|  9  |  10 |\r\n\r\n#### At-Will Powers\r\nAn at-will power is one that can be cast without expending force or tech points. An at-will power's level is 0.\r\n\r\n### Casting Focuses\r\nWhile forcecasting doesn't require a focus to cast force powers, techcasting requires that you have a tech focus in order to cast tech powers.\r\n\r\n## Casting a Power\r\nWhen a character casts any power, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the power's effects.\r\n\r\nEach power description in chapters 11 and 12 begins with a block of information, including the power's name, level, alignment (for Force powers), prerequisites (if it has any), casting time, range, and duration. The rest of a power entry describes the power's effect.\r\n\r\n### Power Alignments\r\nMost force powers are aligned with one of the opposing sides of the Force�light and dark�while many fall somewhere in the middle�universal. You use your Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). Additionally, certain archetypes and feats offer benefits to using powers of a specific alignment.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\nCertain force powers are built as more powerful version of previous powers. They require that you know the previous power before you can learn the new one, and you must retain knowledge of the previous power to be able to cast the new one. If you are learning two or more powers at the same time, you can learn a power at the same time that you learn its prerequisites. \r\n\r\nFor instance, to learn the *knight speed* force power you would first need to learn the *burst of speed* power, as indicated by its prerequisites.\r\n\r\n### Casting Time\r\nMost powers require a single action to cast, but some powers require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\r\n\r\n#### Bonus Action\r\nA power cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You can only cast one 1st-level or higher power using your action or bonus action on each of your turns. Once you've done so, you can only cast at-will powers with your action or bonus action on this turn.\r\n\r\n#### Reactions\r\nSome powers can be cast as reactions. These powers take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a power can be cast as a reaction, the power's description tells you exactly when you can do so.\r\n\r\n#### Longer Casting Times\r\nCertain powers require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a power with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the power, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see \"Concentration\" below). If your concentration is broken, the power fails, but you don't expend force or tech points. If you want to try casting the power again, you must start over.\r\n\r\n### Range\r\nThe target of a power must be within the power's range. For a power like *shock*, the target is a creature. For a power like *explosion*, the target is the point in space where the explosion occurs.\r\n\r\nMost powers have ranges expressed in feet. Some power can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other powers, such as the *shield* power, affect only you. These powers have a range of self.\r\n\r\nPowers that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the power's effect must be you (see \"Areas of Effect\" later in this chapter).\r\n\r\nOnce a power is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the power's description says otherwise.\r\n\r\n### Duration\r\nA power's duration is the length of time the power persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some powers specify that their effects last until the powers are dispelled or destroyed.\r\n\r\n#### Instantaneous\r\nMany powers are instantaneous. The power harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its effect exists only for an instant.\r\n\r\n#### Concentration\r\nSome powers require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their effect active. If you lose concentration, such a power ends.\r\n\r\nIf a power must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the power specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\r\n\r\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\r\n\r\n- **Casting another power that requires concentration.** You lose concentration on a power if you cast another power that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two powers at once.\r\n- **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a power, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as a blaster shot and a force power, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\r\n- **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a power if you are incapacitated or if you die.\r\nThe GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as turbulence on a ship or rocky terrain on a speeder, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a power.\r\n\r\n### Targets\r\nA typical power requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the power's effect. A power's description tells you whether the power targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below). Unless a power has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a power at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a power says otherwise.\r\n\r\n#### A Clear Path to the Target\r\nTo target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover.\r\n\r\nIf you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.\r\n\r\n#### Targeting Yourself\r\nIf a power targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a power you cast, you can target yourself.\r\n\r\n### Areas of Effect\r\nPowers such as *force storm* and *explosion* cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\r\n\r\nA power's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the power's effect erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its **point of origin**. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some powers have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.\r\n\r\nA power's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the power's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover, as explained in chapter 9.\r\n\r\n#### Cone\r\nA cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that points distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.\r\n\r\nA cone's point of origin is not included in the cones area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\r\n\r\n#### Cube\r\nYou select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side.\r\n\r\nA cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\r\n\r\n#### Cylinder\r\nA cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the power description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the power effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The power's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.\r\n\r\nA cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.\r\n\r\n#### Line\r\nA line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width. A line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\r\n\r\n#### Sphere\r\nYou select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.\r\n\r\nA sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.\r\n\r\n### Saving Throws\r\nMany powers specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a power's effects. The power specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.\r\n\r\nThe DC to resist one of your powers equals 8 + your force- or tech-casting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.\r\n\r\n### Attack Rolls\r\nSome powers require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the power effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a power attack equals your force- or tech-casting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. Most powers that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't incapacitated (see chapter 9).\r\n\r\n### Combining Effects\r\nThe effects of different powers add together while the durations of those powers overlap. The effects of the same power cast multiple times�or identical effects from separate powers�don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect~such as the highest bonus�from those castings applies while their durations overlap.\r\n\r\nFor example, if two consulars cast *guidance* on the same target, that character gains the power's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice. Alternatively, if a character is targeted by both *knight speed* and *tactical advantage*, they only gain the benefits once.","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"10","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Introduction","chapterNumber":0,"contentMarkdown":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nThe Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&D is driven by imagination. It's about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.\r\n\r\nThis overhaul is designed as a *Star Wars* reskinning of the core Dungeons and Dragons experience. The rules are generally the same, and so an experienced player of 5th Edition should have no trouble jumping right in to a *Star Wars* themed campaign. For the less experienced player, this Introduction will cover the basics of the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons, appropriately reskinned for the setting.\r\n\r\n**Game Master (GM):** After traveling the streets of Nar Shaddaa, you find yourself at the entrance to the Black Sun compound. Security cameras scan the surrounding area, and a cadre of bored-looking guardsmen wait impatiently by the door. Two twi'lek urchins plead for handouts from the Black Sun mercenaries, only to be yelled at and pushed away. A shimmering barrier covers the entrance to the compound, with a manned security console on its left side.\r\n\r\n**Rickey (playing Vinto):** I want to talk my way into the compound. I approach the guards.\r\n\r\n**Drew (playing Dash):** I want to throw a grenade and then shoot them all.\r\n\r\n**Eric (playing Kodo):** ...\r\n\r\nUnlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers' action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their \r\n\r\n**Game Master (GM):** OK, one at a time. Rickey, you're approaching the guardsmen?\r\n\r\n**Rickey:** Yeah. Do they seem to be doing anything?\r\n\r\n**GM:** Make a Wisdom check.\r\n\r\n**Rickey:** Does my Perception skill apply?\r\n\r\n**GM:** Sure!\r\n\r\n**Rickey (rolling a d20):** Ugh. Seven.\r\n\r\n**GM:** You can see a couple of them crouching over the ground but you can't make out what they're doing. And Drew, Dash is prepping a grenade?\r\n\r\n**Drew:** Yup!\r\n\r\n**GM:** Okay. Eric, what's Kodo doing?\r\n\r\n**Eric:** ...\r\n\r\nadventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a Force-wielder's shock, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.\r\n\r\nIn the *Star Wars* Dungeons and Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might explore a planet-encompassing city like Coruscant, the wilds of Kashyyyk, or the war-torn expanse of Oricon. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle the legendary Jedi or Sith, and discover special modified items and other treasure.\r\n\r\nOne player, however, takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), the game's lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe the entrance to a Black Sun compound, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they charge in, guns blazing? Convince the guardsmen they belong there? Or use other means to find an entrance?\r\n\r\nThen the GM determines the results of the adventurers' actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.\r\n\r\nThe game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a **campaign**. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each force defeated, each adventure completed, and each relic recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer's level.\r\n\r\nThere's no winning and losing in *any* Dungeons and Dragons game�at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can beseech a powerful Jedi to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.\r\n\r\n## Worlds of Adventure\r\nThe many worlds of the *Star Wars* Dungeons and Dragons game are places of mysticism and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of science fiction and fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and mystery that make these worlds unique.\r\n\r\nNaturally, this conversion is designed to explore the myriad worlds of the *Star Wars* universe. I personally designed it to be used in the Old Republic era as characterized by the **Knights of the Old Republic** games and **The Old Republic** MMORPG. Utilizing this timeframe allows greater justification for a prevalence of force-wielders.\r\n\r\nAll these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and species, fantastic geography, ancient ruins, and scheming villains. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the Separatists' war on Ord Mantell. Ultimately they're all *Star Wars* worlds, and you can use the rules in this book to create a character and play in any one of them.\r\n\r\nYour GM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of *Star Wars*, you should check with your GM about any house rules that will affect your play of the game. Ultimately, the Game Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the setting is a canon world.\r\n\r\n## Using This Book\r\nThe *Player's Handbook* is divided into twelve chapters.\r\n\r\n**Chapters 1-6** are about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you'll play in the game. It includes information on the various species, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in these chapters rely on material found later in the book. If you come across a game concept that you don't understand, consult the book's table of contents. \r\n\r\n**Chapters 7-9** details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. It covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game: exploration, interaction, and combat.\r\n\r\n**Chapters 10-12** is all about the Force and technology. It covers the nature of casting in the worlds of *Star Wars*, the rules for them, and the huge variety of powers available to characters in the game.\r\n\r\n## How to Play\r\nThe play of the Dungeons and Dragons game unfolds according to this basic pattern.\r\n\r\n**1. The GM describes the environment.** The GM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, who's in the cantina, and so on).\r\n\r\n**2. The players describe what they want to do.** Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, \"We'll take the east door,\" for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a container while a second examines a symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for enemies. The players don't need to take turns, but the GM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.\r\n\r\nSometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the GM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the GM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.\r\n\r\n**3. The GM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions.** Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.\r\n\r\nThis pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious noble, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty rancor. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and GM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.\r\n\r\nOften the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and GM, relying on the GM's verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some GMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and GMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a GM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.\r\n\r\n### Game Dice\r\nThe game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.\r\n\r\nIn these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d 10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).\r\n\r\nPercentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.\r\n\r\nWhen you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, \"3d8 + 5\" means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.\r\n\r\nThe same d notation appears in the expressions \"1d5\", \"1d3\" and \"1d2.\" To simulate the roll of a d5 or d3, roll a d10 or d6, respectively, and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it's a 2.)\r\n\r\n### The D20\r\nDoes an adventurer's vibroblade swing hurt a rancor or just bounce off its leathery hide? Will the guard believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a Sith's *force storm*, or does he or she take full damage from the tempest? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons and Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure. \r\n\r\nEvery character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six **ability scores**. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the **ability modifiers** derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character's or monster's behalf.\r\n\r\nAbility checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.\r\n\r\n**1. Roll the die and add a modifier.** Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character's particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and how to determine an ability's modifier.)\r\n\r\n**2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.** A class feature, a power, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.\r\n\r\n**3. Compare the total to a target number.** If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.\r\n\r\nThe target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a **Difficulty Class** (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an **Armor Class** (AC).\r\n\r\nThis simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.\r\n\r\n### Advantage and Disadvantage\r\nSometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called **advantage** and **disadvantage**. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a die roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second die when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage on a d20 roll, roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17. More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7.  \r\n\r\n### Specific Beats General\r\nThis book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that govern how the game plays. That said, many special traits, class features, powers, unique items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.\r\n\r\nExceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don't have proficiency with sniper rifles, but every Chiss does because of a special trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can't normally leap 30 feet, but some powers make that possible. The Force and technology account for most of the major exceptions to the rules.\r\n\r\n### Round Appropriately\r\nFollow standard rules for rounding; if a number ends in one-half or greater, round up, while if a number ends in less than one-half, round down.\r\n\r\n### Targets\r\nMany features and powers include specific language on what is a valid target, typically citing ally, friendly creature or hostile creature. The definition of each is included below.\r\n\r\n#### Ally\r\nAn ally is any creature that would be considered friendly or neutral to you, but does not include you.\r\n\r\n#### Friendly Creature\r\nA friendly creature is any creature that could be considered an ally to you, as well as you.\r\n\r\n#### Hostile Creature\r\nA hostile creature is any creature that is antagonistic towards you.\r\n\r\n## Adventures\r\nThe Dungeons and Dragons game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Game Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, special traits, equipment, and special items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.\r\n\r\nThe adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Game Master or purchased off the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the GM's needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a wonderous setting, whether it's an underground enclave, a crumbling temple, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure's action.\r\n\r\nOver the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a mystical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they'll try to do next.\r\n\r\nAdventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to safety to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.\r\n\r\nBut that's not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series�a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.\r\n\r\n### The Force and Technology\r\nFew *Star Wars* adventures end without interacting with a force- or tech-caster. Whether helpful or harmful, powers appear frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus of chapters 10, 11, and 12.\r\n\r\nIn the worlds of *Star Wars*, practitioners of the Force are uncommon, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent. \r\n\r\nFor adventurers, though, the Force and technology are key to their survival. Without the healing prowess of a Jedi or a sawbones, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting support of a scholar, soldiers might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer power and versatility of a consular, every threat would be magnified tenfold.\r\n\r\nThe Force and technology are also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of casters who are hell-bent on using power for some ill end. A mercenary leader subjugates the surrounding community, a renegade Sith saps the life from their victims, a vindictive droid takes over a space station with the intent of destroying its oppressors�these are just a few of the threats that adventurers might face. With power of their own, in the form of the Force and special items, the adventurers might prevail!\r\n\r\n### The Three Pillars of Adventuring \r\nAdventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.\r\n\r\n#### Exploration\r\nExploration includes both the adventurers' movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Game Master telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing the deserts of Tatooine or an hour making their way through the winding passages of an abandoned base. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character flipping a switch in a room to see what happens.\r\n\r\n#### Social Interaction\r\nSocial interaction features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the least well guarded entrance to the mercenary base, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from the leader of a group of criminals, or persuading an informant to garner information about a distant location.\r\n\r\nThe rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 and personality traits in chapter 4.\r\n\r\n#### Combat\r\nCombat, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting powers, maneuvering for position, and so on�all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a D&D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there's still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by flipping a mysterious switch), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"0","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Personality and Backgrounds","chapterNumber":4,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 4: Personality and Backgrounds\r\n\r\nCharacters are defined by much more than their species  and class. They're individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and species define. This section expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.\r\n\r\n## Character Details\r\nYour character's name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. It's worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.\r\n\r\n### Name\r\nYour character's species description includes sample names for members of that species. Put some thought into your name even if you're just picking one from a list.\r\n\r\n### Sex\r\nYou can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture's expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. Some species believe in companionship that doesn't take into account gender. You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man or a man who feels trapped in a female body. Likewise, your character's sexual orientation is for you to decide.\r\n\r\n### Height and Weight\r\nYou can decide your character's height and weight, using the information provided in your species description. Think about what your character's ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and Durable character might be tall or heavy.\r\n\r\nYou can also roll randomly for your character's height and weight using that species's Physical Characteristics table, as shown above. The first dice roll given in the second column determines the character's extra height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the second dice roll or quantity given in the second column determines the character's extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.\r\n\r\nFor example, as a human, Obi-Wan has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus 2d10 inches. We roll 2d10 and gets a total of 12, so Obi-Wan stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then we use that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 pounds. His 2d4 roll is 3, so Obi-Wan weighs an extra 36 pounds (12x3) on top of his base 110 pounds, for a total of 146 pounds.\r\n\r\n___\r\n> ## Human\r\n> ___\r\n> #### Physical Characteristics\r\n> |||||\r\n>|:--|:--|:--:|:--:|\r\n> |***Height***||4'8\"|+2d10\"|\r\n> |***Weight***||110 lb.|x(2d4) lb.|\r\n\r\n### Other Physical Characteristics\r\nYou choose your character's age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.\r\n\r\n### Alignment\r\nA typical creature in the galaxy has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality, and is typically defined in terms of the Force: (light, dark, or balanced), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.\r\n\r\nThese brief summaries describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment. \r\n\r\nYou can pick your alignment or roll to determine it randomly. Roll separately for Morality and Society.\r\n\r\n|d6|Morality|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1-2|**Light:** Usually the needs of others outweigh my own, (...)|\r\n|3-4|**Dark:** Usually my needs outweigh others', (...)|\r\n|5-6|**Balanced:** Usually circumstances dictate whose needs are more important, (...)\r\n\r\n|d6|Society|\r\n|:--:|:--|\r\n|1-2|**Lawful:** (...) but the means are as important as the end.|\r\n|3-4|**Chaotic:** (...) but the ends justify the means.|\r\n|5-6|**Neutral:** (...) but either the ends or the means may be more important, depending.|\r\n\r\n#### Alignment in the Galaxy\r\nFor many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans and ugnaughts can choose whether to follow the paths of darkness or light, of law or chaos. Lanniks tend to follow the light side, while sith purebloods tend toward the dark. Chiss are lawful, while aqualish are often chaotic.\r\n\r\n### Languages\r\nYour species indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.\r\n\r\nChoose your languages based on the species you commonly interact with. If you have a wookiee sidekick, you might understand-if not speak-Shyriiwook. Alternatively, if you commonly trade with Jawas, you might speak Jawaese.\r\n\r\nA list of the most commonly spoken languages of *Star Wars* can be found below in the Common Languages table.\r\n\r\n##### Common Languages\r\n\r\n||\r\n|:--:|\r\n|   Binary  |\r\n|\tBith\t|\r\n|\tBothese\t|\r\n|   Catherese   |\r\n|   Cerean  |\r\n|\tCheunh\t|\r\n|   Devaronese  |\r\n|\tDosh\t|\r\n|\tDurese\t|\r\n|   Ewokese |\r\n|\tGalactic Basic\t|\r\n|   Gamorrese   |\r\n|   Gungan  |\r\n|\tHuttese\t|\r\n\r\n||\r\n|:--:|\r\n|   Ithorese    |\r\n|\tJawaese\t|\r\n|\tKel Dor\t|\r\n|\tMon Cal\t|\r\n|   Nautila |\r\n|\tRodese\t|\r\n|\tShyriiwook\t|\r\n|\tSith\t|\r\n|   Sriluurian  |\r\n|\tTogruti\t|\r\n|   Tusken  |\r\n|\tTwi'leki\t|\r\n|\tZabraki\t|\r\n\r\n### Personal Characteristics\r\nFleshing out your character's personality�the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity�will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character's favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.\r\n\r\nEach background presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to spark your imagination. You're not bound to those options, but they're a good starting point.\r\n\r\n#### Personality Traits\r\nGive your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. \"I'm smart\" is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. \"I've read every book I can get my hands on\" tells you something specific about your character's interests and disposition.\r\n\r\nPersonality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character's self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.\r\n\r\nA useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.\r\n\r\n#### Ideals\r\nDescribe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.\r\n\r\nIdeals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing you strive for?\r\n\r\nYou can choose any ideals you like, but your character's alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: dark, light, or neutral. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.\r\n\r\n#### Bonds\r\nCreate one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character's connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character's motivations and goals.\r\n\r\nBonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession?\r\n\r\nYour bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your species, or some other aspect of your character's history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.\r\n\r\n#### Flaws\r\nFinally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character's flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness�in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What's the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\nInspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that's true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a power that has been laid on you.\r\n\r\n### Gaining Inspiration\r\nYour GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.\r\n\r\nYou either have inspiration or you don't - you can't stockpile multiple \"inspirations\" for later use.\r\n\r\n### Using Inspiration\r\nIf you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.\r\n\r\n## Backgrounds\r\nEvery story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a pit fighter or a grizzled soldier. Your consular could have been a student or an envoy. Your operative might have gotten by as a government agent or commanded audiences as an entertainer.\r\n\r\nChoosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?\r\n\r\nThe sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.\r\n\r\n#### Proficiencies\r\nEach background gives a character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in chapter 7.\r\n\r\nIn addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5.\r\n\r\nIf a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.\r\n\r\n#### Languages\r\nSome backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by species. See \"Languages\" earlier in this chapter.\r\n\r\n#### Equipment\r\nEach background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule from chapter 5 to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment from your background.\r\n\r\n#### Background Feat\r\nEach background gives a character a starting feat. Feats are described in chapter 6. \r\n\r\n#### Suggested Characteristics\r\nA background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation.\r\n\r\n### Customizing a Background\r\nYou might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, a total of two tool proficiencies or languages, and a feat that lacks a level requirement. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in chapter 5. (If you spend credits, you can't also take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can't find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"4","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Preface","chapterNumber":-2,"contentMarkdown":"","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"-2","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Species","chapterNumber":2,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 2: Species\r\n\r\nA visit to any of the great cities in the worlds of  *Star Wars* overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants. \r\n\r\nAnd the people themselves-people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues-represent many different species, from diminutive bothans and stalwart cereans to majestic twi'leks and towering wookiees, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.\r\n\r\nScattered among the members of these more common species are the true exotics: a hulking besalisk here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly chiss there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of jawas chatters as one of them activates a clever mechanical toy that moves of its own accord. Zabraks and devaronians live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone dros-a fugitive from the the Galactic Republic, trying to make his way in a world.\r\n\r\n### Choosing a Species\r\nHumans are the most common people in the worlds of *Star Wars*, but they live and work alongside ithorians, kiffar, mirialan, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples. \r\n\r\nYour choice of species affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a bothan can be a good choice for a sneaky operative, a wookiee makes a tough berserker, and a twi'lek can be a master of the Force.\r\n\r\nYour character species not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story. Each species' description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that species, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and special alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their species. It's worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character's background and  personality.\r\n\r\n### Special Traits\r\nThe description of each species includes special traits that are common to members of that species. The following entries appear among the traits of most species.\r\n\r\n#### Ability Score Increase\r\nEvery species increases one or more of a character's ability scores.\r\n\r\n#### Age\r\nThe age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species' expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.\r\n\r\n#### Alignment\r\nMost species have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your sith pureblood follows the light side, for example, in defiance of the Sith Empire can help you better define your character.\r\n\r\n#### Size\r\nCharacters of most species are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few species are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons and heavy shields, as explained in chapter 6.\r\n\r\n#### Speed\r\nYour speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).\r\n\r\n#### Languages\r\nBy virtue of your species, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Each species typically speaks, or at least understands, Galactic Basic as well as having a unique language of their own. Chapter 4 lists the most common languages of the *Star Wars* universe.","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"2","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Step-By-Step Characters","chapterNumber":1,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 1: Step-By-Step Characters\r\n\r\nYour first step in playing an adventurer in the Dungeons and Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a species (such as human or twi'lek) and a class (such as sentinel or scout). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the *Star Wars* galaxy.\r\n\r\nBefore you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking scoundrel, a fervent consular, or a cruel guardian. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny scoundrel who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like non-Human species like Twi'leks or Wookiees? Try building a character of one of those species. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter class. If you don't know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in any *Star Wars* book to see what catches your interest.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What's important is that you come to the table with a character you're excited to play.\r\n\r\nThroughout this section, we use the term character sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it's a formal **character sheet** (like the one at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. An official D&D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.\r\n\r\n> ##### Building Han Solo\r\n> Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player building the iconic character Han Solo, as he is portrayed during the events of Episode IV.\r\n\r\n### 1. Choose a Species\r\nEvery character belongs to a species, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the *Star Wars* worlds. The most common species in the galaxy is human, but there are a myriad of near-Human species available for play, including the four-armed Besalisks, the cunning Trandoshans, the dexterous Twi'leks, and the utilitarian droid. The **Species** chapter provides more information about these species.\r\n\r\nThe species you choose contributes to your character's identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character's species grants particular special traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor powers. \r\n\r\nThese traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the special traits of Lanniks make them exceptional consulars, and Jawas tend to be powerful engineers. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Ugnaught soldiers and Wookiee sentinels, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.\r\n\r\nYour species also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.\r\n\r\nRecord the traits granted by your species on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.\r\n\r\n> ##### Building Han Solo, Step 1\r\n> Since Han Solo is a human, we record all the special traits of humans on our character, including his speed of 30 feet and the languages he knows: Galactic Basic and Shyriiwook.\r\n\r\n### 2. Choose a Class\r\nEvery adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a city, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in the **Classes** chapter.\r\n\r\nYour character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are **class features** � capabilities (including force- or tech-casting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of **proficiencies**: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.\r\n\r\nOn your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.\r\n\r\n#### Level\r\nTypically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in level by adventuring and gaining **experience points** (XP). A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a pirate and done dangerous things before.\r\n\r\nStarting off at 1st level marks your character's entry into the adventuring life. If you're already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D campaign, your GM might decide to have you begin at a higher level, on the assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures.\r\n\r\n> ##### Quick Build\r\n> Each class description in the Classes section includes a section offering suggestions to quickly build a character of that class, including how to assign your highest ability scores, a background suitable to the class, and starting powers.\r\n\r\nRecord your level on your character sheet. If you're starting at a higher level, record the additional elements your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has 0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the minimum amount of XP required to reach that level (see \"Beyond 1st Level\" later in this section).\r\n\r\n#### Hit Points and Hit Dice\r\nYour character's hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).\r\n\r\nAt 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die type is determined by your class. You start with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you'll determine in step 3.) This is also your **hit point maximum**.\r\n\r\nRecord your character's hit points on your character sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see \"Resting\" in the Adventuring section). Whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, you add your Constitution modifier to the roll.\r\n\r\n#### Proficiency Bonus\r\nThe table that appears in your class description shows your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the numbers you'll be recording on your character sheet:\r\n\r\n- Attack rolls using weapons you're proficient with\r\n- Attack rolls with powers you cast\r\n- Ability checks using skills you're proficient in\r\n- Ability checks using tools you're proficient with\r\n- Saving throws you're proficient in\r\n- Saving throw DCs for powers you cast (explained in each force- or tech-casting class)\r\n\r\nYour class determines your weapon proficiencies, your saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in \"Using Ability Scores\", tools in \"Equipment.\") Your background gives you additional skill and tool proficiencies, and some species give you more proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.\r\n\r\nYour proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. Occasionally,\r\n\r\nyour proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only once, and halve it only once.\r\n\r\n> ##### Building Han Solo, Step 2\r\n> Han Solo is best depicted as an operative, so we make a note of the operative's proficiencies and 1st-level class features on the character sheet.\r\n> As a 1st-level operative, Han has 1 Hit Die�a d8�and starts with hit points equal to 8 + his Constitution modifier. Make a note of this; we will record the final number after we determine Han's Constitution score (see step 3). Also make note of the proficiency bonus for a 1st-level character, which is +2.\r\n\r\n### 3. Determine Ability Scores\r\nMuch of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: **Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma**. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.\r\n\r\nThe six abilities and their use in the game are described in the **Using Ability Scores** chapter. You generate your character's six **ability scores** randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to save time or don't like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.\r\n\r\nNow take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character's six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your species choice.\r\n\r\nAfter assigning your ability scores, determine your **ability modifiers** using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to each of your scores.\r\n\r\n> ##### Building Han Solo, Step 3\r\n> We will use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Han's abilities. Han is talented and nimble, so we'll put his highest score, 15, in Dexterity. His next-highest, 14, goes in Charisma.  He then applies the 13 to Intelligence, the 12 to Constitution, the 10 to Wisdom and the 8 to Strength. After applying his special benefits (increasing Han's Dexterity by 2, and his Intelligence and Charisma by 1), Han's ability scores and modifiers look like this: Strength 8 (-1), Dexterity 17 (+3), Constitution 12 (+1), Intelligence 14 (+2), Wisdom 10 (+0), Charisma 15 (+2).\r\n> We then fill in Han's final hit points: 8 + his Constitution modifier of +1, for a total of 9 hit points.\r\n\r\n#### Variant: Customizing Ability Scores\r\nAt your Game Master's option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.\r\n\r\nYou have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying special increases. You can't have a score lower than 8.\r\n\r\nThis method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.\r\n\r\n##### Ability Score Point Cost\r\n|Score|Cost|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|8|0|\r\n|9|1|\r\n|10|2|\r\n|11|3|\r\n|12|4|\r\n|13|5|\r\n|14|7|\r\n|15|9|\r\n\r\n### 4. Describe Your Character\r\nOnce you know the basic game aspects of your character, it's time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in general terms.\r\n\r\nUsing the information in the **Personality and Background** chapter, you can flesh out your character's physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character's **alignment** (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and **ideals**. The **Personality and Background** chapter also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called **bonds**, and the **flaws** that could one day undermine him or her.\r\n\r\nYour character's **background** describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the character's place in the D&D world. Your GM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in the Personality and Background section, and might be willing to work with you to craft a background that's a more precise fit for your character concept.\r\n\r\nA background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with the personality information you develop, on your character sheet.\r\n\r\n##### Ability Scores and Modifiers\r\n|Score|Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|-5|\r\n|2-3|-4|\r\n|4-5|-3|\r\n|6-7|-2|\r\n|8-9|-1|\r\n|10-11|+0|\r\n|12-13|+1|\r\n|14-15|+2|\r\n|16-17|+3|\r\n|18-19|+4|\r\n|20-21|+5|\r\n|22-23|+6|\r\n|24-25|+7|\r\n|26-27|+8|\r\n|28-29|+9|\r\n|30|+10|\r\n\r\n> ##### Building Han Solo, Step 4\r\n> We then fill in some of Han's basic details: his name, his sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (chaotic light). His high Dexterity and Charisma represent his capability and power of presence, and his low Strength represent an unexceptional burliness.\r\n> Han is a notorious scoundrel, so we choose the scoundrel background. Make a note of the proficiencies and special feature this background gives. We choose the Silver-Tongued feat for Han's background feat, adding the bonus to Han's Charisma, bring the total to 16, and the modifier to +3.\r\n> We know that Han is both daring and rash, and has a propensity to gamble, so we choose the fourth and sixth personality traits. We choose the ideal of independence from the list in the background, noting that Han recognizes no one as his master.\r\n> Han's bond is his flight from Jabba the Hutt, so we choose the first option. His flaw is that he often chooses himself and his ship over others, so we choose the sixth option.\r\n\r\n#### Your Character's Abilities\r\nTake your character's ability scores and species into account as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low Strength.\r\n\r\nFor example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump.\r\n\r\nA character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.\r\n\r\nA character with high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.\r\n\r\nA character with high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.\r\n\r\nA character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what's going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.\r\n\r\nA character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.\r\n\r\n### 5. Choose Equipment\r\nYour class and background determine your character's **starting equipment**, including weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your character sheet. All such items are detailed in the Equipment section.\r\nInstead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of **credits** (cr) to spend based on your class, as shown in the Equipment section. Extensive lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that section. \r\n\r\nYour Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. \"**Using Ability Scores**\" has more information on carrying capacity.\r\n\r\n#### Armor Class\r\nYour **Armor Class** (AC) represents how well your character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however.\r\n\r\nWithout armor or a shield, your character's AC equals 10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your AC using the rules in the Equipment section. Record your AC on your character sheet.\r\n\r\nYour character needs to be proficient with armor and shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in the Equipment section.\r\n\r\nSome powers and class features give you a different way to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose which one to use.\r\n\r\n#### Weapons\r\nFor each weapon your character wields, calculate the modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and the damage you deal when you hit.\r\n\r\nWhen you make an attack with a weapon, you roll a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate ability modifier.\r\n\r\n- For attacks with **melee weapons**, use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the finesse property, such as a vibrorapier, can use your Dexterity modifier instead.\r\n- For attacks with **ranged weapons**, use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that has the thrown property, such as a vibrodagger, can use your Strength modifier instead.\r\n\r\n> ##### Building Han Solo, Step 5\r\n> We now write down the starting equipment from the operative class and the scoundrel background. His starting equipment includes a combat suit, giving him an Armor Class of 14.\r\n> For Han's weapons, we choose a vibrodagger and a light pistol. His light pistol is a ranged weapon, and the vibrodagger has the finesse property, so Han uses his Dexterity modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Dexterity modifier (+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The light pistol deals 1d4 energy damage, and Han adds his Dexterity modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total of 1d4+3 energy damage. The vibrodagger deals the same amount of damage, but is kinetic instead of energy.\r\n\r\n### 6. Come Together\r\nMost *Star Wars* characters don't work alone. Each character plays a role within a **party**, a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party's chances to survive the many perils in the worlds of *Star Wars*. Talk to your fellow players and your GM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.\r\n\r\n#### Beyond 1st Level\r\nAs your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.\r\n\r\n#### Class Features and Hit Dice\r\nWhen your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can't increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.\r\n\r\nEach time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum (minimum of 1 hit point). Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll.\r\n\r\n##### Character Advancement \r\n\r\n|Experience Points|Level|Proficiency Bonus|\r\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|\r\n|0\t|1\t|+2|\r\n|300\t|2\t|+2|\r\n|900\t|3\t|+2|\r\n|2,700\t|4\t|+2|\r\n|6,500\t|5\t|+3|\r\n|14,000\t|6\t|+3|\r\n|23,000\t|7\t|+3|\r\n|34,000\t|8\t|+3|\r\n|48,000\t|9\t|+4|\r\n|64,000\t|10\t|+4|\r\n|85,000\t|11\t|+4|\r\n|100,000\t|12\t|+4|\r\n|120,000\t|13\t|+5|\r\n|140,000\t|14\t|+5|\r\n|165,000\t|15\t|+5|\r\n|195,000\t|16\t|+5|\r\n|225,000\t|17\t|+6|\r\n|265,000\t|18\t|+6|\r\n|305,000\t|19\t|+6|\r\n|355,000\t|20\t|+6|\r\n\r\nWhen your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level soldier has a Constitution score of 17, when he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.\r\n\r\n#### XP and Proficiency Bonus Progression\r\nThe Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"1","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Using Ability Scores","chapterNumber":7,"contentMarkdown":"# Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores\r\n\r\nSix abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n- **Strength**, measuring physical power\r\n- **Dexterity**, measuring agility\r\n- **Constitution**, measuring endurance\r\n- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory\r\n- **Wisdom**, measuring awareness and intuition\r\n- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIs a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities�a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.\r\n\r\nThe three main rolls of the game�the ability check, the attack roll, and the saving throw�rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.\r\n\r\nThis chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in chapter 9.\r\n\r\n## Ability Scores and Modifiers\r\nEach of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.\r\n\r\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and villains can have scores as high as 30.\r\n\r\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.\r\n\r\nTo determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).\r\n\r\nBecause ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.\r\n\r\n## Advantage and Disadvantage\r\nSometimes a special ability or power tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\r\n\r\n##### Ability Scores and Modifiers\r\n\r\n|Score|Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|1|-5|\r\n|2-3|-4|\r\n|4-5|-3|\r\n|6-7|-2|\r\n|8-9|-1|\r\n|10-11|+0|\r\n|12-13|+1|\r\n|14-15|+2|\r\n\r\n|Score|Modifier|\r\n|:--:|:--:|\r\n|16-17|+3|\r\n|18-19|+4|\r\n|20-21|+5|\r\n|22-23|+6|\r\n|24-25|+7|\r\n|26-27|+8|\r\n|28-29|+9|\r\n|30|+10|\r\n\r\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\r\n\r\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\r\n\r\nWhen you make a roll with advantage or disadvantage, only the d20 is rolled twice. Any additional dice, such as the d4 granted by the *resistance* force power, are only rolled once.\r\n\r\nWhen you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the iktotchi's Precognition trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if an iktotchi has advantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the iktotchi could use the Precognition trait to reroll the 1.\r\n\r\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or powers. Inspiration (see chapter 4) can also give a character advantage on checks related to the character's personality, ideals, or bonds. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.\r\n\r\n### Advantage on Other Rolls\r\nThough less common, advantage and disadvantage can occur on other types of rolls as well. When you have advantage or disadvantage on a roll, as with a d20, you roll the dice twice, using the higher of the two results with advantage, and using the lower of the two results if you have disadvantage. If a roll has multiple dice, you roll the dice together and treat the results separately.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the second bullet of the Weapon Expert feat grants conditional advantage on a weapon's damage roll once per turn, provided you meet the criteria for that advantage. If any additional dice would be added to the damage roll, such as the operative's Sneak Attack feature or the scout's Ranger's Quarry, those additional dice are only rolled once.\r\n\r\nIf granting advantage or disadvantage on a roll that would have negative consequences rather than positive benefits, advantage and disadvantage should be reversed (as logic dictates). For instance, if a creature has a penalty die on a d20 roll, such as a d4 penalty die from the *denounce* force power, and they get disadvantage on that die roll, they should roll the d4 twice and take the higher roll, instead of the lower.\r\n\r\n## Minimum Roll Threshold\r\nCertain features, such as the Great Weapon fighting style, add a minimum roll threshold, which means your dice can no longer roll below a certain amount, instead treating the die's result as the threshold. This threshold varies depending on the die size: 2 for d4, 2 for d6, 3 for d8, 4 for d10, 5 for d12, and 8 for d20.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a character with the Great Weapon fight style wielding a two-handed weapon that deals 1d12 rolls a 3 on a damage die, they treat the result as if they'd rolled a 5.\r\n\r\n## Proficiency Bonus\r\nCharacters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.\r\n\r\nYour proficiency bonus can't be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved. for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\r\n\r\nBy the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn't normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don't add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the Lore skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (Lore) checks.\r\n\r\nIn general, you don't multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.\r\n\r\n### Expertise\r\nCertain features, such as the Expertise class feature or Ace Pilot feat, grant expertise in a skill or tool, letting you double your proficiency bonus with that skill or tool. As usual, you can only gain expertise in a skill or tool once.\r\n\r\nFar less common, though still possible, a creature can gain expertise in a saving throw. Creatures cannot gain expertise in weapons, however.\r\n\r\n## Ability Checks\r\nAn ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\r\n\r\nFor every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by Difficulty Class (DC). The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Ability Check DCs table shows common DCs.\r\n\r\nTo make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success�the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.\r\n\r\n### Contests\r\nSometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal�for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\r\n\r\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\r\n\r\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.\r\n\r\n##### Ability Check DCs\r\n|Task Difficulty|\tDC|\r\n|:--|:--:|\r\n|Very easy| 5|\r\n|Easy|\t10|\r\n|Medium|\t15|\r\n|Hard\t|20|\r\n|Very hard\t|25|\r\n|Nearly impossible|\t30|\r\n\r\n### Additional Dice\r\nWhen making an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, some features grant an additional die when you make the d20 roll. If features would grant multiple additional dice in such a way, you can only benefit from one of them when you make the d20 roll (you choose which effect to use). For instance, if a creature is forced to make a saving throw, and it is benefiting from both a Potent Aptitude die and the *resistance* force power, it can only use the additional die granted by one of those effects. Conversely, the same is true for penalty dice.\r\n\r\n#### Variant: Additional Die Teamwork\r\nIn some instances, a party might be relying on the outcome made by a single party member's ability check. If multiple party members could grant that character an additional die, while that character couldn't apply multiple dice to the roll, you might consider allowing them to use the larger die provided, and to roll the die with advantage.\r\n\r\n### Multiple Modifiers\r\nAs with additional dice, when making an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, some features might allow multiple modifiers being added to the roll. In these cases, only two modifiers may be added to a roll, and the same modifier can't be added twice unless an effect says so. For instance, if a friendly creature makes a Constitution saving throw within range of a guardian's Aura of Presence, and that creature is also the target of a scholar's Critical Analysis, and they chose to end that Critical Analysis on themselves, they could add either that guardian's Wisdom modifier or the scholar's Intelligence modifier to their Constitution save, but not both.\r\n\r\n> #### Applying During the d20 Roll\r\n> Some features, such as engineer's Potent Aptitude or scholar's Critical Analysis, allow a creature to choose to add an additional die or ability modifier to an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Unless the effect specifically says otherwise, it can be applied before or after the roll, but it must be applied before the GM determines whether the roll succeeds or fails.\r\n\r\n### Skills\r\nEach ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect.\r\n\r\nThe skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.\r\n\r\n- **Strength**: Athletics\r\n- **Dexterity**: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, Stealth\r\n- **Intelligence**: Investigation, Lore, Nature, Piloting, Technology\r\n- **Wisdom**: Animal handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, Survival\r\n\r\n- **Charisma**: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion\r\n\r\nSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill�for example, \"Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.\" At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff. the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.\r\n\r\n#### Variant: Skills with Other Abilities\r\nNormally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. \r\n\r\nSo if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your trandoshan berserker uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.\r\n\r\n### Passive Checks\r\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\r\n\r\nHere's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:\r\n\r\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check. If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.\r\n\r\nFor example. if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.\r\n\r\nThe rules on hiding in the \"Dexterity\" section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in chapter 8.\r\n\r\n### Working Together\r\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort, or the one with the highest ability modifier, can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action (see chapter 9).\r\n\r\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with security kits, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover. a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\r\n\r\n#### Group Checks\r\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something together, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at the task at hand help cover those who aren't. To make a group ability check,  everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.\r\n\r\nGroup checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.\r\n\r\n## Using Each Ability\r\nEvery task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\r\n\r\n### Strength\r\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\r\n\r\n#### Strength Checks\r\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\r\n\r\n***Athletics.*** Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:\r\n\r\n- You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.\r\n- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.\r\n- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\r\n\r\n***Other Strength Checks.*** The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\r\n\r\n- Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door\r\n- Break free of bonds\r\n- Push through a tunnel that is too small\r\n- Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it\r\n- Tip over a statue\r\n- Keep a boulder from rolling\r\n\r\n#### Attack Rolls and Damage\r\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a vibrosword or doublesword. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand�to�hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\r\n\r\n#### Lifting and Carrying\r\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\r\n\r\n***Carrying Capacity.*** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.\r\n\r\n***Push, Drag, or Lift.*** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\r\n\r\n***Size and Strength.*** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature' carrying capacity and the amount it can push. drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\r\n\r\n#### Arm Equipment \r\nCertain equipment, such as a wristpad, light shield, or fixed weapons, are worn on the forearm. A creature can only wield a number of such items on each forearm equal to half its Strength modifier (minimum of one item).\r\n\r\n#### Variant: Encumberance\r\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5.\r\n\r\nIf you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are ***encumbered***, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.\r\n\r\nIf you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead ***heavily encumbered***, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\r\n\r\n### Dexterity\r\nDexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\r\n\r\n#### Dexterity Checks\r\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\r\n\r\n***Acrobatics.*** Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking spaceship's deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\r\n\r\n***Sleight of Hand.*** Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a wallet off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.\r\n\r\n***Stealth.*** Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\r\n\r\n***Other Dexterity Checks.*** The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\r\n\r\n- Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent\r\n- Steer a chariot around a tight turn\r\n- Pick a lock\r\n- Disable a trap\r\n- Securely tie up a prisoner\r\n- Wriggle free of bonds\r\n- Play a stringed instrument\r\n- Craft a small or detailed object\r\n\r\n#### Attack Rolls and Damage\r\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon. such as a blaster rifle or bowcaster. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a vibrodagger or techblade.\r\n\r\n#### Armor Class\r\nDepending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, as described in chapter 5.\r\n\r\n#### Initiative\r\nAt the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat, as described in chapter 9.\r\n\r\n> ##### Hiding\r\n>When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that checks total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.\r\n> You can't hide from a creature that can see you, and if you make noise (such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase), you give away your position. An invisible creature can't be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has to stay quiet.\r\n> In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before you are seen.\r\n> ***Passive Perception.*** When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.\r\n> For example, if a lst-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\r\n> ***What Can You See?*** One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily** obscured, as explained in chapter 8.\r\n\r\n### Constitution\r\nConstitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\r\n\r\n#### Constitution Checks\r\nConstitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks. because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.\r\n\r\nThe GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\r\n\r\n- Hold your breath\r\n- March or labor for hours without rest\r\n- Go without sleep\r\n- Survive without food or water\r\n- Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go\r\n\r\n#### Hit Points\r\nYour Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.\r\n\r\nIf your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.\r\n\r\n### Intelligence\r\nIntelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.\r\n\r\n#### Intelligence Checks\r\nAn Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Investigation, Lore, Nature, Piloting, and Technology skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.\r\n\r\n***Investigation.*** When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient materials in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\r\n\r\n***Lore.*** Your Intelligence (Lore) check measures your ability to recall information about the Force, artifacts, histories, and religions.\r\n\r\n***Nature.*** Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\r\n\r\n***Piloting.*** Your Intelligence (Piloting) check measures your ability to control vehicles, aircraft, and spaceships. Piloting governs your ability to maneuver through tight spaces and debris fields or dogfight with enemy craft. \r\n\r\n***Technology.*** Your Intelligence (Technology) checks measure your ability to recall information about droids, vehicles, spaceships, aircraft, and computers, as well as your ability to interface with them. Technology can also be used to stabilize a droid or construct.\r\n\r\n***Other Intelligence Checks.*** The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\r\n\r\n- Communicate with a creature without using words\r\n- Estimate the value of a precious item\r\n- Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard\r\n- Forge a document\r\n- Recall lore about a craft or trade\r\n- Win a game of skill\r\n\r\n#### Techcasting Ability\r\nTechcasters use Intelligence as their techcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of power they cast.\r\n\r\n### Wisdom\r\nWisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.\r\n\r\n#### Wisdom Checks\r\nA Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone's feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\r\n\r\n***Animal Handling.*** When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\r\n\r\n***Insight.*** Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\r\n\r\n***Medicine.*** A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\r\n\r\n***Perception.*** Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\r\n\r\n***Survival.*** The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that rancors live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\r\n\r\n***Other Wisdom Checks.*** The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\r\n\r\n- Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow\r\n- Discern Whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead\r\n\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nForcecasters use Wisdom as their forcecasting ability for their light side and universal powers, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of powers they cast.\r\n\r\n> ##### Finding a Hidden Object\r\n> When your character searches for a hidden object such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.\r\n> In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the GM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer ofa bureau. If you tell the GM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.\r\n\r\n### Charisma\r\nCharisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.\r\n\r\n#### Charisma Checks\r\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\r\n\r\n***Deception.*** Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\r\n\r\n***Intimidation.*** When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\r\n\r\n***Performance.*** Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance. acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\r\n\r\n***Persuasion.*** When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a Chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\r\n\r\n***Other Charisma Checks.*** The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\r\n\r\n- Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip\r\n- Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation\r\n\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nForcecasters use Charisma as their forcecasting ability for their dark side and universal powers, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of powers they cast.\r\n\r\n## Saving Throws\r\nA saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a power, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.\r\n\r\nTo make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.\r\n\r\nA saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.\r\n\r\nEach class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The operative, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.\r\n\r\nThe Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a power is determined by the caster's force- or tech-casting ability and proficiency bonus.\r\n\r\nThe result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"7","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null},{"chapterName":"Whats Different","chapterNumber":-1,"contentMarkdown":"\r\n### The Player's Handbook\r\nThe Player's Handbook mirrors the traditional 5th edition Player's Handbook, with the following deviations.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 1: Step-By-Step Characters\r\nThis chapter explains step-by-step character building, as exemplified by Han Solo.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 2: Species\r\nRaces relabeled to species, all of which are brand new.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 3: Classes\r\nThere are ten classes. All ten classes receive their archetype at 3rd level, instead of it varying by class. Additionally, all classes have a second level of customization beyond archetype, similar to how Warlocks get Invocations in 5e. Lastly, all class capstones now offer a total of +4 to ability scores, including their maximums. \r\n- **Berserker:** This is an adaptation of the barbarian class, with the additional customization layer of Berserker Instincts. Berserker capstone ability scores reduced, but they gain an additional feature.\r\n- **Consular:** The full caster for the Force side of casting, this class consolidates features of cleric, sorcerer, and wizard. It has Force-Empowered Casting as its second layer of customization, which is derived from sorcerer's Metamagic.\r\n- **Engineer:** The engineer is a full caster for the tech side of casting, extrapolating from artificer with some bard elements sprinkled in. The additional layer of customization for engineers is driven from its archetypes.\r\n- **Fighter:** Similar to it's 5e counterpart, with two major changes: maneuvers are now a baseline feature, and fighters gain strategies are their second level of customization.\r\n- **Guardian:** Mostly derived from paladin, guardians are the half caster for the Force. Their second level of customization is their auras.\r\n- **Monk:** Monks are naturally inspired by their 5e counterpart, but with a significant number of changes and buffs. They gain a second level of customization in their Monastic Vows.\r\n- **Operative:** This version of the rogue has operative exploits as their second level of customization. Additionally, most archetypes grant alternative ways to use Sneak Attack.\r\n- **Scholar:** This brand new class has two levels of customization beyond archetypes: maneuvers (similar to that of the fighter class) and discoveries.\r\n- **Scout:** This is the half caster for the tech side of casting, naturally inspired by the ranger, with baseline hunter's mark and a second level of customization called Scout Routines.\r\n- **Sentinel:** This Force caster utilizes a new \"two-thirds\" casting progression, falling between guardian and consular. It utilizes some bard features, and has an additional layer of customization called Sentinel Ideals.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 4: Backgrounds\r\nBackgrounds feature one major difference; each background also offers a choice of feat. This helps players realize their characters in a more personal fashion.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 5: Equipment\r\nCurrency has been changed to credits, with roughly 1 gp = 10 cr. Magic items are reskinned as enhanced items, with rarities designed to mimic those of **Star Wars: the Old Republic**. Equipment functions similarly, with the exception of the breakdown of weapons; rather than just simple and martial, they are broken down into blasters, lightsabers, and vibroweapons. This also includes three tiers of shields: light, medium, and heavy, with proficiencies collapsed into the appropriate armor. There is a significant number of new weapon properties as well, and most items are new otherwise.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 6: Customization Options\r\n- New multiclassing requirements/proficiencies\r\n- Spell point variant with different multiclassing\r\n- Fighting styles have been completely changed, with paired fighting masteries\r\n- Lots more feats\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores\r\nGenerally the same, with the exception of skills; Arcana, History, and Religion have been collapsed into Lore, with Piloting and Technology being new skills. Expertise is now a defined keyword alongside proficiency.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 8: Adventuring\r\nMinor changes to better fit the galaxy at large.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 9: Combat\r\nLots of changes here. This chapter will want to be read start to finish, despite it being similar to traditional 5e.\r\n- Object Interaction is now more specifically defined and utilized.\r\n- New action: Guard.\r\n- Shoving split in to two separate keywords so they can be cited independently.\r\n- Double-Weapon Fighting is a new mechanic for weapons with two ends for fighting.\r\n- Two-Weapon Fighting now works with blasters.\r\n- Three layers of partial cover, instead of only two, with adjusted values.\r\n- Critical Hit Range a defined attribute.\r\n- Damage types have been changed.\r\n- Rules for temporary force and tech points, which function similar to temporary hit points.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 10: Force- and Tech-casting\r\nThere are several changes in this section:\r\n- Spells are now called powers.\r\n- Cantrips are now called at-will powers.\r\n- There are no more class lists. Instead, your force- or tech-casting feature gives you access to the full force or tech powers list.\r\n- A simplification of the spell point variant from the DMG. Basically, casting a power at a given level costs that level + 1 points.\r\n- Spellcasting has been separated into force- and tech-casting. Forcecasting uses Wisdom/Charisma and Force Points, which regenerate on a long rest. Techcasting uses Intelligence and Tech Points, which regenerate on a short or long rest. While a character can have both force- and tech-casting, they are kept completely separate.\r\n- The number of known at-will powers and 1st-level and higher powers are no longer separate. \r\n\r\n#### Chapters 11 and 12: Force and Tech Powers\r\nChapter 11 has been broken down into two chapters to keep force and tech powers separate.\r\n\r\n#### Chapter 13: Maneuvers\r\nUnlike 5e, Maneuvers are a single pool of options similar to spells that any class or archetype with superiority can select from.\r\n\r\n#### Appendix A: Conditions\r\nThis appendix features most (all?) of the traditional 5e conditions, as well as a couple new ones.\r\n\r\n#### Appendix B: Recommended Variant Rules\r\nThis appendix features a number of highlighted variant rules.\r\n\r\n#### Index\r\nIt's an index.\r\n\r\n# Introduction","contentTypeEnum":1,"contentType":"Core","contentSourceEnum":0,"contentSource":"None","partitionKey":"Core","rowKey":"-1","timestamp":"0001-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","eTag":null}]
